<p><span class="smcap">P<b>HOTO-LITHOGRAPHY,</b></span>
with its many branches and its extended
application, when used direct and also as handmaid for the
lithographer and printer from stone, is, with the exception of
phototypy and autotypy, indeed that process for the preparation
of letterpress plates which has done the most towards making
photography useful for the graphic arts, in the artistic sense as
well as from the practical point of view. And in the near future
it will be a great acquisition when it is once generally recognized
that colour plates can be prepared by photographic means without
any considerable amount of manual or artistic help. It is the
more to be wondered at that photo-lithography has not yet found
that extension and general use which it in so high a degree
deserves.</p>
</div>

<p class="padtopc">I have written this book, impressed with the urgency of
stimulating the propagation of this useful process. In writing I
have been careful to avoid all those details which are for the
practical worker of minor interest—the description of the
historical evolution, etc., so instructive as these must certainly be—so
that I have abstained from many complicated and unintelligible
formulæ. I leave this willingly to a more ready
writer. Starting rather from the standpoint of speaking as a
practical worker to practical men, I have recorded all the
experience which I have gained in the course of many years.</p>

<p class="padtopc">Should it occur to me in the future that it was my task to have
treated all photo-lithographic processes, with all their ramifications,
in the most complete manner, I have still the consciousness
of having described as completely as possible the practical
processes, and think that I have thus been useful
to many workers, <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span>
and I dare say with absolute certainty that only tested and tried
formulæ have been noticed in this book.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p class="padtopc">With the earnest wish that this book may be received with a
fraction of the goodwill with which I have worked at the writing
of the same, I present it to the technical world.</p>

<p class="padtopa">On receiving this work for review I was greatly struck with the
thoroughly practical manner in which it was written, and thought
that an English translation might be acceptable to the large and
ever increasing class of photo-mechanical workers who might not
otherwise have the opportunity of reading it in the original. I
have kept to the author’s text as close as is consistent with the
idiomatic construction of German.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>I am indebted to Messrs. Hazell, Watson and Viney for permission
to undertake the task of translating the work for another firm
of publishers, and I hope the translation may prove as acceptable
and useful to the readers as it has been pleasurable to me to
do it.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein" id="p003">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline">1.—<i>The theory of printing from stone.</i></h3>
He who would study or
practise photo-lithography must first become acquainted with the
fundamental principles on which lithography rests. I find it
therefore necessary to first give in concise form a small treatise
on the theory of this process as well as on the most important
materials which are necessary in the practice of the same.</div><!--dh3-->
</div>
<p>The theoretical principle of lithography is purely chemical, and
is based principally on the repulsion of water and other substances
by fatty bodies, and the alteration of these greasy bodies
by acids. As the support for this chemical opposition a stone or
zinc plate is used, which are sufficiently porous to allow grease,
water, acid, and certain resinous solutions to penetrate to a certain
degree.</p>

<p>The fatty substances which are transferred to the stone by
writing, drawing, or transfer, are autographic ink, lithographic
ink, and chalk, the so-called transfer and photo-lithographic
colours. There are also other substances, which are used
especially in photo-lithography, which do not evidently penetrate
the stone and which cannot be considered as greasy substances,
but which, as we shall see later on, have exactly the same action.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned fatty substances actually penetrate the
porous stone and make it in places suitable to take more printing
ink. By the so-called etching—dilute nitric acid mixed with
gum water—two effects are produced. On the one hand the
fatty bodies are altered in chemical composition, being decomposed
into the fatty acids which combine intimately with the material
of the stone—calcium carbonate. On the other hand, the surface
of the stone not covered with the fatty substances is chemically
changed, since the carbonate of lime is converted into nitrate,
which has now the property of keeping moderately damp when
moistened with water, and thus repelling grease. If such a
transfer of greasy bodies on to the stone is allowed to act for some
hours, and the fatty substances are removed with turpentine, it
will be seen that these places have a lighter colour than the other
parts of the surface of the stone, and if the stone be rolled up
with a leather roller, charged with a greasy ink,
after the stone <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
has been damped, only these places will take the greasy ink. By
means of a litho steam or hand press prints can then be prepared
from this.</p>

<p>It is frequently necessary to make corrections or additions to the
drawing on the stone; if the stone has been already etched some
means must be used <i>which will remove the action of the etching</i>, or
else the stone will not take the greasy matter, or at least not so
readily as is desirable. Very weak acetic acid, about 1–2 per cent.,
will do this. If the stone is flowed over with this dilute acetic
acid or dilute table vinegar, the action of the stronger nitric acid
and the gum is stopped, and the surface of the stone will again
take fatty matter.</p>

<p>Before the penetration of the grease the stone is prepared by
polishing with a concentrated solution of oxalic acid. Oxalic acid
poured on to the stone would exert an etching action, but make the
stone to a certain degree capable of taking the ink. If this liquid is
rubbed on the stone with a cloth or linen pad with moderate
pressure, the stone receives a high polish—especially the hard
kinds—and in this condition the stone takes the ink well, like any
flat object, but will not retain it. If a transfer is made on to such
a stone, and the same etched, the image will completely disappear
the first time the roller passes over it. This polish can be removed
with 1 or 2 per cent. acetic acid, and the stone then has its
primitive qualities. This method is used to reverse the image,
which will be described later on.</p>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline">2.—<i>Litho stone</i></h3>
is dense limestone of the mountain limestone
group, and is found in the Tertiary deposits at a depth of
two to three metres. Its constituents are lime, clay, and silicious
earths, combined with carbonic acid, but lime is in the preponderance;
it only contains a very small proportion of silica. In the
stronger acids litho stone dissolves completely. The varieties of
very fine stalactitic chalk of tolerable hardness, with flat shell-like
fracture, without rust spots, glassy crystals or impurities, and those
with very even grain, are the most useful for photo-lithography.
Marble, which consists of pure chalk, cannot be used for lithography
because, on account of its greater density, the greasy matter
cannot penetrate so deeply, and therefore such stones would give
only a few pulls.</div><!--dh3-->

<p>The commercial litho stones are of different colours, from
whitish yellow to greenish shining grey. The latter has a finer and
more even grain, and is considerably harder than the other kind.
These two kinds are briefly designated in the trade as “yellow”
and “blue,” and the brighter kinds are, as a rule, softer and
cheaper than the darker.</p>

<p>The faults which the stones sometimes show differ considerably,
and these produce certain inconveniences in continuous work.
Many stones have dark and light spots, and as these spots have, as
a rule, different densities, the etching solution
cannot exert the <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
same action over the whole of the stone, and consequently in fine
drawings, autotypes, etc., there are formed bright and dark spots.
This also occurs with calcareous, speckled, and marbly stones. The
very bright stones have less density, and therefore suck up the
damping solution very quickly, and begin with repeated printing to
become tinted. Stones with calcareous, rusty or other veins split
easily, especially in the large sizes. Lime spots or lime veins,
which are easily recognized by their brighter colour, take in graining
a very unequal grain. The drawing is darker on these places,
since the grain is greater according to the softness of the stone.
Such stones are unsuitable for those photo-lithographic processes
in which graining is used, such as the processes of Orell and
Füssli and Bartös. The so-called glass veins and glass spots are
crystallizations consisting of silicon, and are harder than the other
parts of the stone. On these places the fatty inks do not penetrate
deep enough, and the drawing does not adhere well, and can be
easily removed by the rollers.</p>

<p>The hard stones receive a much finer surface than the soft
when polished with pumice stone; they also reproduce every
point, line, and detail of the drawing much more delicately,
finer, and sharper; and, lastly, they have the advantage that
they etch much more evenly, and re-etching is easy if moderate
care be taken.</p>

<p>For the finer photo-lithographic work, if quality and continuous
working is desired, only the good “blue” stones should be used;
for cheaper line drawings “yellow” stones free from faults may be
used.</p>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline">3.—<i>The zinc plates</i></h3>
are now coming into pretty general use instead
of stones, especially in large establishments. Although their
treatment before and during printing is essentially different to
that of the stones, yet so far as regards this method of printing
they come very nearly equal to stones. At first smooth polished
zinc plates were used, but in consequence of some difficulty
in using them, and the great care necessary in choosing them,
they have been almost replaced by the prepared or oxidized
plates.</div><!--dh3-->

<p>Zincographic processes differ essentially in the preparation of
the plates. In the one, the plate is given a coating which has a
similar composition to a litho stone; in the other, the plate is
roughened and given a fine grain by a mechanical method, such as
the sandblast, in order that it may be then oxidized by a chemical
process, with acids or alkalies. All these processes are more or
less advantageous. The zinc plates cost about one-tenth to one-twentieth
of the cost of the stones, and this may well be sufficient
grounds for the proprietors of large establishments being interested
in zinc plates, as the stones are rather costly.</p>

<p>Excellent zinc plates, coated with a film or merely oxidized, can
be procured commercially in Germany and
Austria. For those <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
who wish to prepare their own plates the following tested formulæ
are given:—</p>

<p>A zinc plate from 1 to 1·5 mm. thick is roughened by means of
the sandblast till it has a fine, even grain and appears smooth, but
clean. The following solution is prepared:—</p>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline">4.—<i>The greasy drawing materials</i></h3>
which are necessary for lithography
are litho tusch, autographic ink, and fatty chalk.</div><!--dh3-->

<p>The two first are used in the liquid state, the chalk, however, in
solid form. The ink can be obtained in a liquid form and the two others
in solid state. All three materials consist principally of
soap, tallow, wax, resin, and soot. Soap and tallow give the necessary
grease, wax and resin give hardness and consistency, and soot
the colour. The proportion of grease in the drawing materials
must be so great that even the finest lines or points of a drawing
can be well transferred to the stone, so that they may not be
attacked by the proper etching solution, and do not break away
from the stone by continuous printing. As much black as possible
in the drawing materials is pleasant for the draughtsman, but is
not actually necessary for
this particular purpose. <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span></p>

<p>The tusch must dissolve well in distilled water and flow fine
and clean from the pen. It should be tolerably brittle, and the
fractured surfaces should be shiny. The photo-lithographer will
frequently require the lithographic tusch for additions or for
corrections. The best is the so-called Lemercier’s tusch, which
is used in nearly all works. It consists of—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">These ingredients should be melted together by boiling.</p>

<p>The autographic ink is, as a rule, used for drawing or writing
on paper, and the result is then transferred to the stone. Instead
of this, any litho tusch can be used, but for some work the autographic
ink is more advantageous. This ink must be thin, run
easily, but not patchily, from the pen, and must keep for a long
time equal in quality and action. It is very advantageous that
specially-prepared paper is not required, since this always makes
the work more difficult; firm, hard writing-paper is quite
good enough for this work. The commercial inks generally
possess these good qualities, and if much is not required one will
hardly care to prepare it oneself. A good successful autographic
ink which draws in brown may be obtained from the following

<p>For lithographic work a greasy ink is required in contra­dis­tinc­tion
to ordinary printing ink, which consists of linseed oil
and lamp­black, which would be called “lean.” For inking-up a
photo-lith­o­graphic chromated gelatine print such an ink cannot be
used. In order to obtain a good result in trans­ferring, this ink
must contain grease, soap, and resin.</p>

<p>Any good transfer ink can be used for a developing ink, as this
is applied with a roller. It usually consists of equal parts of
tallow, wax, soap, some resin, and as much litho ink as all the
other ingredients put together.</p>

<p>That prepared by C. Kampmann, Technical Instructor in the
K.K. Lehr-&nbsp;und Versuchsanstalt at Vienna, contains, besides the
above-named ingredients, asphalt and gum elemi, and works well
in practice.</p>

<p>Thin developing inks, which are distributed with a broad brush
or a pad, can be prepared by diluting good transfer ink with
equal quantities of wax, benzine, and turpentine.</p>

<p>A good developing ink must have the following properties:
When spread upon the print must give a clean, sharp, sufficiently
dense impression, which can be easily transferred to the plate or
stone; on the other hand, the drawing ought not to spread. The
transfer should possess such resistance that, without rolling up,
it should resist a slight etching.</p>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline">5.—<i>The behaviour of asphalt on stone or zinc.</i></h3>
When a stone or
plate is coated with asphalt solution and exposed under a negative,
and then washed with turpentine, the exposed parts remain
insoluble, and in this way photo-lithographs can be prepared.
The asphalt here takes the place of the fatty ink, and is, after
printing, so firm and hard that without any rolling or inking up it
can be etched with a weak, gummy, etching solution, which gives
a cleaner, sharper drawing than the other processes. The asphalt
and other light sensitive resins not only intimately combine with
the stone or plate, but chemically alter the surface of the stone,
and possibly in a more advantageous way than the greasy inks.
When a properly-exposed drawing on stone is, immediately after
printing and development, treated for a long time with rectified
or Neustadt turpentine, it is completely removed from the stone,
and it will be found that the drawing appears of a somewhat
lighter colour than the rest of the surface of the stone. If this is
now inked up with a roller, these places take up the ink <i>without
having previously come into contact with grease</i>. Numerous experiments
which I have made on various lines go to
show that the <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
chemical theory of lithography has found an important enlargement
with the use of asphalt.</div><!--dh3-->

<p>The following are principal conclusions to be drawn from my
experiments:—</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) The exposed asphalt, whether this exposure is made by
printing or whether a drawing is first made and then exposed
to the light, adheres more firmly to the stone or zinc plate
than if it was not exposed. An asphalt drawing prepared
in the dark and inked up does not adhere to the stone, and this
may be explained in that the grease cannot act through the
asphalt film. Insensitive asphalt behaves in the same way.
With correct exposure under a clear negative of about 20 degrees
Vogel, and subsequent development and auxiliary exposure for
about half to one hour, the drawing adheres firmly to the stone. If
the image is to be washed off, the turpentine must act for five to ten
minutes on the film, till the exposed asphalt has dissolved. If, after
washing off, it is inked up, all the places take the ink well, and
the image appears clear and plain. The image can only be
destroyed by strong acids or alkalies, which actually dissolve the
stone itself.</p>

<p>From this it is clear that the prints neither require inking up
nor strengthening in any other way, and my experiments have
proved that in all cases the prints are, by this treatment,
clogged up, and neither gain as regards a longer run nor in withstanding
etching.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Solution of asphalt, to which oil has not been added, behaves
as described above; if, however, oil is added to it, it acts still
better as regards the keeping of the drawing, and the prints need
no subsequent exposure. Too large an addition of oil has the
disadvantage that, in developing with turpentine, the asphalt
dissolves too quickly. The images wash off and one hardly has
time to examine. The exposed asphalt, to which oil has been
added, also dissolves very readily. For the preparation of colour
plates this point is of some importance.</p>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline" title="Etching and Preparing Solutions">6.</h3>—The
etching and preparing solutions are those solutions
which make the stone suitable or unsuitable for taking the grease
or water. Generally these are acids and gum arabic, either used
alone or together.</div>

<p>Of the acids the most important is <i>nitric acid</i>, the purpose of
which is to convert the surface of the stone into a nitrate, so that
the grease cannot penetrate. This acid acts even when diluted
very energetically on the stone, and produces a fine grain.</p>

<p><i>Hydrochloric acid</i> exerts a less energetic action; it leaves the
stone smoother and does not attack it so evenly as nitric acid, but
has the same result finally.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuric acid</i> ought not to be used for etching stone. It forms
calcium sulphate on the surface of the stone, and this separates
from the stone in printing and
spoils the pulls. <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span></p>

<p><i>Phosphoric acid</i> may be used for etching as well as for preparing
the stone; it exerts a very faint etching action and is seldom
used for this purpose, but principally for making corrections.</p>

<p><i>Acetic acid</i> plays a very important part in lithography. It
possesses the property, even in very dilute condition, of stopping
the action of the gum and oxalic acid, and, indeed, even that of
the stronger nitric, sulphuric, and hydrochloric acids. It finds,
therefore, considerable use in negative printing, in making
corrections, etc. It converts the stone into its original condition
and makes it suitable again for taking ink.</p>

<p><i>Citric acid</i> fulfils the same purpose, but is, however, much
higher in price.</p>

<p><i>Oxalic acid</i> is not used for etching, but only for preparation of
the stone. By rubbing the stone with a solution of oxalic acid
with a pad of cloth it takes a mirror-like surface or polish, into
which the fatty ink cannot penetrate. It is used for preparing
the stone for lithogravure, negative drawing, and negative
transfer, etc.</p>

<p><i>Tincture of galls</i>, or instead of this, what is simpler, gallic acid,
is used in lithography. It contains plenty of tannin, and is one of
the most efficacious means of preventing the combination of the
stone or zinc plate with fatty substances.</p>

<p><i>Gum arabic</i> or some other vegetable gum is indispensable for
litho and zincography. A 10 per cent. solution of gum is generally
used. It penetrates all the pores of the stone and the plate, and
gives the same a thin but very firm film, and prevents the ink
taking on these places. If it has become slightly acid it acts as a
weak etcher, and as an addition to nitric acid it makes the same
of thicker consistence and more easily distributable. The action
of gum can be removed with acetic or citric acid; with water alone
this cannot be perfectly effected.</p>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline">7.—<i>Etching the stone.</i></h3>
There are two principal etchings, the
<i>simple ordinary or first etching</i>, which obviously has the purpose of
giving the drawing the necessary stability and protecting the
blank places from taking ink, and <i>the deep or sharp etching</i> gives for
combination printing a still greater lasting power, and for large
runs keeps the drawing clean and sharp.</div><!--dh3-->

<p>The ordinary etching chiefly causes the fatty substances to
assume a new chemical condition, since in combination with the
stone they form insoluble fatty salts of lime, which represent the
printing surfaces. It has, however, also the property of cleaning
the blank stone surfaces from any adherent grease, and makes the
blank parts of the stone incapable of taking ink; also it makes the
drawing clearer and more precise.</p>

<p>The strength of the first etching may differ, according to the
following circumstances:—</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) The stone; for hard stones stand a stronger, and soft stones
a weaker etching. <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span></p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The printing image; fine drawings must at first be etched
with a weaker solution; coarser drawings, on the other hand, will
stand a fairly strong etcher.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) The material with which the print or drawing has been
prepared; very fatty developing inks and asphalt stand well even
with strong etching, whereas with lean or hard inks only a weak
etching should be used.</p>

<p>An etching solution which is at the limit of strength, but still
suitable for a hard stone or a very coarse drawing, would
irretrievably ruin a very fine drawing on a soft stone.</p>

<p>Commercial acids differ considerably in strength, and it is, therefore,
better to use a hydrometer than a measure. It is also
always more satisfactory not to use the acid by itself, but in conjunction
with gum. A solution of gum of eight to ten degrees
strength is diluted with nitric acid till it measures 10 to 12
degrees on the hydrometer. This solution may be safely used for
every case, and it is only necessary to allow it to act longer for
coarser drawings; it should be evenly distributed over the surface
of the stone with a clean soft pad. In very hot weather it acts
more energetically, and then it should be used weaker for fine
work. In any case it is advisable to let the stone or plate stand
for some hours before etching, so that the ink may thoroughly
combine. The etching of zinc plates will be more fully described
later on; in other respects the treatment is the same as for stone.</p>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline">8.—<i>Deep-etching process.</i></h3>
The idea of this is chiefly to increase
the printing form and to make the stone more resistant in printing.
In working this the principal thing is to sufficiently protect the
drawing from the action of the strong acid. This is generally
done by dusting with resin, which has a low melting point.</div><!--dh3-->

<p>There are two deep-etching processes which are chiefly used,
one in which the resin is melted with a spirit flame, the other in
which the same thing is done by ether vapour.</p>

<p>The procedure in each case is extremely simple. In the so-called
burnt-etching process, which has been perfected by Eberle,
of Vienna, the already etched stone ready for printing is rolled up
with a very stiff printing ink, not transfer ink, and then the
drawing dusted with the finest powdered resin. The stone is then
gone over with a cotton-wool pad and plenty of talc or French
chalk, and then well dusted off with a broad camel’s hair brush in
order to remove all traces of resin from the blank stone. To melt
the resin a spirit lamp with a side flame is used. The flame is
passed over the drawing, and ought only to be allowed to act
sufficiently long to make the resin combine with the ink, which can
be recognized by the drawing looking shiny. If it has been
melted too long the sharpness of the drawing is damaged. After
this the etching may be at once proceeded with, and this is effected
with a solution of gum to which 8 to 10 per cent. by measure of
44 per cent. nitric acid has been added. For fine
drawings 4 to <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
6 per cent. of acid should be used. In using this a fairly strong
effervescence takes place, which should not frighten anyone.</p>

<p>In the ether or cold-melting process exactly the same procedure
takes place, only that instead of melting with an open flame this
is effected by ether vapour.</p>

<p>For this work a wooden stick of about 2 mm. thick is laid on
two edges of the stone. On another ruler, which should be large
enough to cover the whole of the stone, and which should be
covered with flannel or stout cloth, ether is poured; this ruler is
laid on the others, so that it forms a right angle with them, and is
slowly drawn over the surface of the stone. The ether vapour
falls on to the surface of the stone and dissolves the resin which
thus forms the protective film for the deep etching, which is done
precisely as described above.</p>

<p>Another melting process recommended by Scamoni consists in
pouring alcohol on the stone and then setting fire to it.</p>

<div class="dh3">
<h3 class="h3inline">9.—<i>Differentiation of the printing processes.</i></h3>
Technically we
differentiate the principal printing methods into three, according
to the method of production. <i>The first and oldest</i> is the typographic
or letterpress printing, which is founded on the principle
that every line or every point which ought to print must stand up
on the plate, and all those places which must appear white in the
print must be sunken in. The artistic effect is obtained by tones
which are formed of individual lines or points, which are closer
together or further apart, or else print finer or deeper. In printing
a forme or plate, etc., it must be “made ready,” that is to say,
the pressure in printing must be so arranged for each part of the
picture that on the lighter places or finer places less pressure
must be exerted, whilst on the deeper tones more pressure should
fall, according to their gradation. This balancing, which is
technically termed “making ready,” is effected by cutting out the
delicate and building up the strong or dark parts on the overlay.
With a proper overlay the artistic effect of the picture can be
much increased; with a faulty overlay it can be quite spoilt.
In letterpress printing the artistic element lies in the making
ready.</div><!--dh3-->

<p>Typographic prints are distinguished by the lines, figures, etc.,
being somewhat pressed into the paper, and show raised up on
the back, which is technically termed “impression.” When this
“impression” is very plain, that is to say when the printing has
gone pretty deeply into the paper, it is advisable before reproduction
to remove this by strong pressure.</p>

<p>The second method of printing is exactly the opposite of the
first, and is founded on the principle of printing from intaglio.
The lines and points which should print are cut mechanically (by
engraving or piercing) or chemically (by etching) into the stone.
The etched or engraved intaglio plate represents a negative, or a
reversed wood-cut, only with the difference that the
lines do not <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span>
lay in the same plane. In order to obtain an impression the ink
is pressed into the cut-out parts, and is wiped off from the surface
of the plate. By stronger or weaker wiping the print receives a
stronger or weaker local tone, which is of great advantage from
an artistic point of view, but which forms no small obstacle to the
reproduction.</p>

<p>The impression is represented in relief on the paper. According
to the depth of the lines they take more or less ink, and appear
therefore raised up in the impression according to the amount of
their depth in the plate. Reproduction photography has to
reckon on this disadvantage, for with a side illumination the
raised up lines cast shadows, and a correct negative does not
follow.</p>

<p>By the third method, lithography, of which we have already
spoken, the impression lies generally flat on the paper like a drawing,
if a very strong deep etching was not used, in which case it is
also slightly raised. In printing from the graver or from stone etching
a faint relief is generally noticeable, which is never so high as
with copperplate printing, and which is no important obstacle to
making a photographic negative.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<span class="smcap">P<b>HOTO-LITHOGRAPHY.</b></span></h3>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">B<b>Y</b></span>
photo-lithography we generally understand that process by
which it is possible to prepare a printing plate or a stone by the
aid of photography from any original, whether it be a drawing, a
print, or an oil painting, either of the same size or smaller or
larger than the original, which can be reproduced in the lithographic
press.</p></div>

<p>The main characteristic of this process is that either the
original from which the reproduction is to be made must be prepared
in distinct lines, strokes or points, or that any half-tone
which may be present in the photographic negative must be
broken up on the stone or plate into lines or points.</p>

<p>The basis for the preparation of a photo-litho is as a rule a
photographic negative on glass or gelatine, which, as the word
negative implies, when examined by transmitted light, must have
all its tones reversed, that is to say, the drawing or the lines,
strokes or points which must in the print be black, must look
transparent, whilst the other part of the negative which forms the
groundwork must be covered or opaque.</p>

<p>If every photo-lithographic process was to be described in detail
there would be a great many, but actually they may all be
classified according to two principal methods:—</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) One, in which the stone or plate is itself coated with the
light sensitive substance and exposed under a reversed negative,
so that a reversed image is formed on the stone or plate, which in
printing comes in the right position, and</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) The other, in which paper or a very thin zinc plate, provided
with a light sensitive film, is exposed under an ordinary,
that is not reversed negative, and thus is rendered capable of
receiving fatty ink, and is then transferred to the stone or plate
by transfer.</p>

<p>Of the many processes which, though differing in detail, may,
looking to the final result, be assigned to one or other of the
above-mentioned principles, there are two which have been
especially tested in practice, namely, for <i>the direct transfer</i>, as we
will call it, that process which is based on the light sensitiveness
of asphalt or of an organic substance in
combination with a <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
chromium salt; and for <i>the indirect transfer</i>, that process which is
founded on the light sensitive chromium salt in combination with
gelatine, or briefly on the light sensitiveness of chromated gelatine.
All other more or less complicated methods have disappeared from
technical practice and have only the honour of being scientifically
interesting and theoretically correct, but for various reasons are
not practically valuable.</p>

<p>It is indeed obvious that a discovery so important and useful
to one of the principal departments of the graphic arts as lithography
is, and which may be called even more essentially capable
of variation and multiplication, and perhaps in its way also more
artistic, should call forth an earnest movement on behalf of the
technical experts, principally with the endeavour for simpler forms
and extension of its powers of work. This, indeed, has not always
been attained, and these attempts will therefore only be taken into
consideration in this book as may appear necessary, and all others
will be passed over in silence.</p>

<p>The methods used by some experimentalists for direct transfer,
which consist in coating the stone with a solution of gelatine,
albumen, or gum made light sensitive with a chromium salt,
and after exposure under a positive or negative, obtaining a
printing plate, were in execution complicated and troublesome, but
in results fairly safe and satisfactory, so that they are now more
and more used in practice.</p>

<p>Iron and silver salts have been proved as not very suitable for
photo-lithography, and at the present time for direct transfer
asphalt is most generally used, and latterly also organic substances
rendered light sensitive by a chromium salt; for indirect transfer
chromium salts in combination with gelatine, or chromated gelatine.</p>

<p><i>Asphalt</i> exposed to the action of light undergoes a chemical
change which consists in its becoming less soluble in its original
solvents. This was known to Nicephore Niépce, one of the discoverers
of photography, whose endeavours to produce images by
the action of light were actually based upon this very property of
asphalt. He used for this purpose metal plates which were converted
by a species of etching into printing plates.</p>

<p>In the year 1852, the well-known Parisian lithographer
Lemercier, in partnership with Lerebours, obtained a patent in
France for a process by which they were in a position to obtain
images on stone by the exposure of asphalt, and thus reproduce the
same by printing in the ordinary way. They coated a lithographic
stone with ethereal solution of asphalt, exposed it under a negative
and developed it with ether; there remained behind then the parts
which had been rendered insoluble by light and formed a positive
asphalt image on the stone, the outlines of which had the property
of taking up greasy ink and with suitable preparation of giving an
impression on paper. Such a stone was etched in the ordinary
way with acid and gum, and then it was possible to
make as many <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
pulls from it as was desired in litho ink. We have here a practical
photo-lithographic asphalt process, as it is at the present time
practised with various modifications, and which gave satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>Other resins besides asphalt may also be rendered sensitive to
light, and it is well-known that they also may be used with as
good results as asphalt for photo-lithography.</p>

<p>That the good qualities of asphalt were even earlier recognized
is proved by the fact that Negré, before the discovery of zinc
etching, exposed a copper-plate coated with asphalt solution under
a negative, washed out the places not affected by light, electroplated
these blank places in a gold bath, then cleaned the plate
and deep etched it with acid. He obtained in this way an intaglio
printing plate similar to an etching.</p>

<p>By using a positive with this process a relief or typographic
plate may be obtained, both of which processes are known as “gold
etching,” and were practised in the beginning of the ’50’s in the
K. K. Hof-&nbsp;und Staatsdruckerei.</p>

<p>The asphalt which is used for photo-lithographic purposes must
possess certain qualities, of which the most important is as high
a light sensitiveness as possible. With ordinary asphalt success
will not be attained, since it is only slightly sensitive to light; the
so-called Syrian asphalt is therefore generally used, which after
having been prepared is dissolved in chloroform and then benzole
and oil of lavender are added.</p>

<p>Professor Husnik prepares an asphalt from which all constituents
not sensitive to light have been extracted. Herr Valenta produces
his sulphurized asphalt. Both possess a far higher light sensitiveness
than ordinary Syrian asphalt, and are specially suitable for
photo-lithography.</p>

<p>The second, and considerably more extensively used method for
photo-lithography—a transfer process—is based on the light sensitive
property of the chromate salts in combination with gelatine,
or albumen, or gum.</p>

<p>That the bichromate salts possessed light sensitive properties,
and could be used for photo-lithography, Mungo Ponton discovered
in 1839. He printed on an ordinary paper, which had been
rendered sensitive to light in a solution of potassium bichromate,
drawings and silhouettes, and obtained after fixing, which was
effected by merely washing in pure water, brown images on a white
ground.</p>

<p>Later Talbot found that the chromate salts in combination with
organic substances under the action of light altered the property
of the latter, and particularly that exposed chromated gelatine
became insoluble in hot water. Poitevin used this discovery for
carbon or pigment printing, and had produced in 1855 various
pictures with this process.</p>

<p>Poitevin discovered, further, that
exposed chromated gelatine <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span>
would not swell up in cold water and took up greasy ink, and
therefore after exposure under a photographic negative a picture
could be obtained exactly inversely corresponding to the tones of
the negative; and that these places affected by light could be inked-up
and printed from, or could be transferred to a zinc or stone
plate, and from this pulls could be prepared. By this discovery
photo-lithography and collotype were actually discovered.</p>

<p>Led on by his success, Poitevin used later, instead of gelatine,
albumen and gum arabic, and prepared with these photo-lithographic
prints, which were transferred to stone.</p>

<p>If a solution of gelatine is mixed with a solution of bichromate
of potash, and a sheet of paper coated with this mixture and exposed,
or if the paper is first coated with gelatine and then bathed
in a solution of bichromate of potash, various chemical changes
take place as the result of the action of light on the gelatine film,
which we will now consider.</p>

<p>As has already been mentioned, glue or gelatine is insoluble, and
only swells up in cold water. In warm water, however, the gelatinous
substance dissolves completely, and sets on cooling to a jelly.
If a suitable sheet of paper is coated with the warm gelatine solution,
either by floating or pouring it over it, and it be allowed to set,
and if this film is now made light sensitive in a solution of potassium
bichromate and dried in the dark, we shall have a photo-lithographic
paper which, according to the greater or less quantity
of the chromium salt used, has a more or less intense yellow colour.
If the paper thus prepared is exposed to light under a negative, or
in another way if some places before exposure are protected by
black ink or strips of paper, the places affected by light become
dark coloured and brown, and at the same time they have lost
their power of swelling up in cold water. The whole surface of
the paper, that is to say the exposed and unexposed films before
being laid in water, are flat or in one plane; if, however, the print
is laid in cold water the exposed parts are not affected by the
water, that is to say they have lost the property of swelling and
remain in their original plane. The unexposed parts swell up and
appear raised up on the print, and thus make the drawing sunken
in.</p>

<p>The exposed places have, however, now received the property of
taking up and holding greasy ink, whilst the unexposed have taken
up water and repel greasy printing ink.</p>

<p>If the paper be exposed under a negative the drawing appears
sunken in after development with water; the other parts, which
must in printing appear white, are raised up; by exposure under a
positive the reverse is the case.</p>

<p>If these prints are in any way, either by rolling up or brushing
over, given a coating of greasy ink, the ink only adheres to the exposed
places and a print in greasy ink is obtained, which, like any
other greasy impression, can be transferred to a stone
or a metal <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
plate, which can be printed from direct, or the transfer may be
made on to a metal plate for relief etching, that is to say for the
preparation of a typographic block.</p>

<p>In Poitevin’s process the stone itself was coated with a light sensitive
chromated film, and exposed under a reversed negative.
After developing and careful preliminary preparation of the stone
the ink only adheres then to the places affected by light.</p>

<p>This is also the case if the stone is coated with light sensitive
asphalt, and the same printed on direct. After exposure the parts
not affected by light can be washed off with turpentine, benzine, or
linseed oil, so that the stone is laid bare; the places, the parts of
the drawing affected by light, however, are not dissolved. If the
stone is now prepared with the solution of gum as has already
been described, and then rolled up with an ink roller, these places
will take the ink, and by etching, etc., the stone may be so prepared
that the same may be printed from like any drawing or
engraving.</p>

<p>By photo-lithography only line or grained drawings can be reproduced,
and half-tones, as is possible with collotype and photogravure,
cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>Now, with the aid of autotypic transfers and the asphalt process
on grained stones, we have a perfectly satisfactory method of reproducing
in an excellent manner half-tone drawings by the aid of
photo-lithography.</p>

<p>Photo-lithography in all its various branches of application is
at the present time so perfected, and rests on so comparatively a
simple principle, that a technical printer, with very little practice,
experience, and observation of the formulæ given, can attain in very
short time absolutely good results. At the same time it must
be said that frequently very great difficulties have to be contended
with; especially as regards the quality of the materials and
negatives great care must be used.</p>

<p>The next question which arises is, “What can be reproduced or
multiplied by means of photo-lithography?”</p>

<p>The answer is, “According to the existing state of the technique
of photography and the perfection of the transfer process, everything.”
Any line or wash drawing, any oil painting or other
plastic object, any photograph of living creatures or lifeless objects—briefly,
any photograph can, under certain conditions, be transferred
to stone or a metal plate, and from this any number of
impressions in greasy ink be obtained. Before the discovery
of the method of breaking up half-tones into points or dots, only
line drawings could be reproduced by photo-lithography. Since,
however, it has been possible to break up half-tone into line or
points or grain, nothing stands in the way of
reproducing by this <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
method any kind of original. This breaking up of the half-tone
into a regular or irregular grain can be effected by means of a
crossed line screen in making the negative, as in autotypic, or
half-tone, block-making, or independently of the making of the
negative, as in the asphalt process of Orell, Füssli and Co., and in
Bartös’ process and various other methods.</p></div>

<p>The undesirable half-tone must, however, always be broken up
in some way into the requisite points or lines, as it is one of the
characteristics of lithography that it is only possible to print from
distinct figures on the stone. Lithography and letterpress printing
produce impressions of sharply-defined lines or points, each of
which must form a distinct whole. Any tone which is lighter or
not absolutely black must be formed by lines or points standing
in close proximity to one another. The tonality must be formed by
stronger or weaker lines or points, by black and white spaces, or
by more or less close line and point patterns. An absolutely closed
tone, as in collotype or photogravure, is not attainable with
lithography, and although numerous experiments have not been
wanting to reach this end, the same have hitherto been without
success.</p>

<p>The half-tones are broken up and separated into solid printable
points:—</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) By the autotypic transfer, which is effected by placing in
front of the sensitive plate when making the exposure the above-mentioned
crossed-line screen.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) By the so-called asphalt process, by means of preliminary
graining of the stone before coating with asphalt and printing.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) By means of the production of a grain on chromated
gelatine.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) By the use of a sand blast, which is the chief point of
Bartös’ process.</p>

<p>(<i>e.</i>) By transfer of a close grating or network on to a polished
stone, which forms the basis of the litho-heliogravure process of
General-Director Chas. Eckstein, which is included in photo-lithography.</p>

<p>All these methods have for their purpose the breaking up of the
light tones into regular or irregular but separate points. There
are other methods besides those mentioned above which have the
same purpose.</p>

<p>We generally distinguish two kinds of reproduction:—</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) Those from line drawings, in which a negative is made
without the interposition of a cross-lined screen, and for which no
other means is used for the production of a grain, and</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) Those from wash-drawings, paintings, photographs from
nature, etc., in which reproductions the half-tones are either
broken up into lines or points by the use of the screen when
making the negative, or by any of the other above-mentioned
means after making the negative.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="h4blk" id="p021">(<span class="smmaj">A.</span>)
<span class="smcap">L<b>INE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">D<b>RAWINGS.</b></span></h4>

<p>By the first method the drawing must be prepared according to
certain formula if a good negative is to be obtained which shall
not require much after work and disadvantages for photo-lithography.
A poor original may cause a partial or complete failure
of the work, or at least cause much cost and waste of time;
therefore it appears advisable to pay the necessary attention to
the original which is to be reproduced.</p>

<p>What a line drawing must possess which should be reproduced
well by photo-lithography in order to give a good transfer on to
stone we will now point out.</p></div>

<p>Before all things should be noted that the paper must be pure
white and smooth, yet not strongly reflective and not too weak.
Smooth white cards of medium thickness are the best to use.
Since all lines of the drawing appear in the impression of the
same colour, there is not only no purpose, but it may even be very
disadvantageous to the reproduction when the draughtsman, in
order to increase the artistic effect of his work, or to produce good
perspective, etc., draws fine lines or other points in a lighter
colour. The striving of the artist for effect, perspective, etc., so
far as this is attained by lines or parts of a lighter colour, has for
this process of reproduction no advantage, but, indeed, the disadvantage
that by this the subsequent manipulations are rendered
more difficult, the whole work will turn out more costly and finally
less satisfactory.</p>

<p>Although from the present position of photography drawings in
any desired colour can be reproduced, yet it is most advantageous
if the originals for photo-lithographic reproduction are drawn
with fine black matt ink on smooth white papers, and the principal
point to which attention should be directed is that all lines, even
the finest, should be a good black, and should be kept of the same
strength of colour as the other parts of the drawing. The thick
lines must be quite filled up like the shadow lines of a strong
letter. Shading must be obtained by strong, fine running lines
quite separate from one another. In this the single black lines
must not be too strong, and the white spaces in between must not
be too narrow, or otherwise when reduced in size the white
interstices will disappear and will finally form a solid tone. The
laying on of a tone or wash is not permissible, as even a light tone
will appear in the reproduction as a black spot. It is not permissible
also to draw on the same original with inks of different
blackness or consistency, and even if a coloured ink be used the
whole original must be prepared with one colour (red, dark blue,
green, or brown), and that as intense as possible. When we start
from the only true standpoint, that every reproduction should be
a reflex of the original as true as possible, artistic effects have from
this point of view no purpose, since the printer
in printing with <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
one ink is not in a position to give grey lines as well as black, but
can only give the appearance of everything in one colour only. He is,
however, able to give with the strongest line the finest with their
own characteristics, and can, therefore, in this direction attain the
tonality of the original.</p>

<p>It is obviously, therefore, the artist’s duty to draw in one colour,
and since for photographic reproduction black is the best, that is
to say Chinese ink, he will do well to completely lay on one side
all other artistic materials or effects. At the same time it should
be noted that originals drawn in any other colour can be reproduced
by photo-lithography, but if the drawing is to serve no other
purpose than for reproduction it is best to prepare it in black.</p>

<p>A further important requirement is that the drawing be sharply
and cleanly worked, and since the reproduction of a ragged or
broken line cannot make a full smooth beautifully running line, they
will appear in the reproduction in the same defective way, and
then require at least tedious retouching or make the printing of
the subject actually impossible. If it is necessary to cross the
lines in the shadows this must be done with great care. The
points of crossing must be clean and sharp, and the ink must not
run. Too close or too frequent crossing of the lines should be
avoided, and would produce a bad and different effect in the
reproduction. Smudges or wrinkles in the original appear in the
reproduction more intense and more vigorous, and therefore it
must not be forgotten to carefully avoid these, also any tracing
lines must be erased, without, however, damaging the ink lines or
rubbing up of the paper.</p>

<p>Pencil and chalk drawings, assuming that they are cleanly
executed, can be well reproduced by photo-lithography, only they
ought not to be smudged or inked. Erasure marks on pencil
drawings appear in the reproduction as smudgy spots.</p>

<p>Drawings of architecture for illustration or other purposes,
after consideration of these remarks, can be well transferred without
much trouble by photo-lithography on to stone or zinc.</p>

<p>In drawings of maps, plans, etc., there are still some rules to be
observed besides the above. Boundary lines or mountain ranges
with fine hatching, waterlines for large rivers, seas or lakes, as
well as the introduction of figures, are better left out of the
drawing, and can be afterwards drawn on the stone; they will
then be cleaner and sharper. If all these details, however, must
be introduced into the original drawing, they should be executed
in a pale blue colour, which will not appear in the ordinary
negative.</p>

<p>For plans with large letters it is better not to draw the latter,
which are frequently a lot of trouble, but to employ the simpler
plan of getting the titles, writing, legends, explanations, etc.,
printed by a book printer on paper of the same colour as the
original, and stick them on the latter. The same
method may be <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
adopted when preparing railway, postal, and telegraphic charts or
maps with a lot of names or other titles, etc. The network of
lines may be drawn with litho ink as suggested above, but the
names of the stations, etc., can be printed with letterpress and
stuck on in the proper places. Working in this way not only will
much labour be saved, but at the same time sharper and more
correct titles be obtained on the reproduction.</p>

<p>Any necessary instructions for carrying out the drawing should
never be made on the paper with red pencil, but either with pale
grey or pale blue. For this paper rubbed with indigo or graphite
can be used or a scratched gelatine proof which has been rubbed
with finely powdered milori blue.</p>

<p>With commercial drawings it frequently happens that ornaments
are repeated. It is not necessary for the designer to draw all the
ornamentation, which may frequently be very complicated, if it
runs over the whole of the design. It is quite sufficient, according
to the size or the number of times that the ornament occurs,
for the artist to draw it twice or three times, or sometimes ten to
fifteen times; the lithographer will duplicate it by transfer. This
also applies if there is a border, or if there are any corner or
centre pieces repeatedly used. It is quite sufficient to draw one-fourth
of the frame or border, or with very complicated designs a
complete corner, and to give the printer a rough sketch of the
complete border. He will make the necessary impression on
transfer paper by photo-litho transfer on the stone; he will also
reverse the drawing from right to left, join up the different parts,
and thus construct the whole border. This applies also to the
corner and centre piece.</p>

<p>As a substitute for a proof cyanotype or blue prints may be
used for preparing drawings for photo-lithography and other
graphic arts. When a photo-lithograph like a pen and ink drawing
is to be prepared from a coloured picture, or from a sepia or
Indian ink wash drawing of a plastic object or a photograph
from nature, or from an object not suitable for photographic
reproduction an autotypic transfer is to be prepared, a proof of
the desired object must be first prepared, and then from this the
drawing is to be made. It is obvious that the proofs of the first-named
can only be made in the original size, which under some
circumstances may not be just what is required, assuming that
the original can be used in this way. In all cases this will be
inconvenient and tedious, and possibly from the nature of the
drawing many proofs be lost. The end will be attained far more
quickly and safely if a negative is made of the original, either of
the same size or enlarged according as may be desired. The
negative thus obtained is used to make
a ferro-prussiate print. <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
For this we use a good firm drawing paper, which is sensitized in
the following mixture:—</p></div>

<div class="dtablebox">

<p>When dissolved each solution is filtered and mixed in the dark
room immediately before use in equal parts. The solution thus
formed is sensitive to light and is spread on a well-sized drawing
paper as evenly as possible with a broad brush, equalized with a
distributing brush, and then dried in the dark room.</p>

<p>The coated side of the paper appears yellowish. It is then
printed as usual until the deepest parts look grey, as the prints
look weaker after developing. The prints are developed by
floating them face downwards on a dish of pure water not too
cold, and then washed till the drawing appears quite white on a
blue ground. The washing must be thoroughly done or else the
prints turn blue afterwards when exposed to light. These prints
contain all the finest details, even in the deepest shadows, plainly
visible, and will now be the most, perfect and most convenient
proofs for the artist. The tracing or drawing is now done with
good black dull surface ink as already suggested. When the
drawing is done it is allowed to dry thoroughly, which will be in
from two to three hours. The following solution should be
prepared:—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">The blue colour will now have disappeared, and the ink drawing
will appear pure black on the white paper. It should be now
hung up and dried in the ordinary way. This drawing prepared
in wash or line with ink now forms the original for a further
photographic negative, which is made in the correct size of the
reproduction with or without the intervention of the crossed
screen according to the character of the drawing. With the
negative thus obtained a photo-litho on stone or zinc, or a typographic
copper or collotype plate, or a photograph on wood for
xylography may be prepared.</p>

<p>The use of this process appears specially important for those
cases in which an ordinary photographic negative
is not sufficient, <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
for example where a printing plate cannot be prepared from the
negative. It ought also to be useful when the light could not be
controlled in making the negative, and thus incorrect effects
appear in the reproduction, which often occurs in negatives from
nature and with polished plastic metal objects. The enlargements
from the original are then used because the details can be
better seen, and the artistic character can be more easily seen.
The fineness of the drawing must obviously be in proportion to
the after reproduction, while tones may be partly or entirely lost.</p>

<p>For photo-litho transfer without the use of a screen there are
some commercial papers, toned, grain, net or pyramid grained
papers which may be used with excellent results.</p>

<p>On these papers, according to their preparation, various
excellent results can be obtained, which possess high claims as
illustrations.</p>

<p>A smooth white scraper board made by Angerer and Göschl of
Vienna, which has a very even film of chalk, and which takes the
lines clean and vigorously, is especially suitable for pen and ink
work. On this paper plucky drawings like woodcuts can be
executed. The perfect whites of the paper, combined with the
vigorous beautiful black, facilitate reproduction with excellent
results and without much trouble.</p>

<p>An ordinary writing pen and ordinary Chinese ink are used for
drawing. The ink gives sufficiently black and matt lines.</p>

<p>The deepest parts are covered with ink, and the desired shading
or stippling put in with the toothed scraper or engraving tool.
The shading off of the shadows may also be worked up with the
toothed scraper, and thus very delicate shading be obtained.</p></div>

<p>Two more very useful papers by the same firm are known as
scraper boards with printed lines or points, and white scraper
boards with simple or double lines stamped on to it. These
papers are also coated with a chalk film.</p>

<p>With these papers the printed lines or dots serve as half-tones
for the artist, and by scraping with smooth or toothed scraper
knives very many effects can be obtained. Lead pencil, chalk or
litho ink can be used for drawing. For laying on, ordinary ink
with a small addition of soap may be used, and
new tone effects <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
may also be produced with a half dry Chinese ink brush, but for
any drawing for line reproduction washing with paler or darker
inks is excluded. By scraping with the smooth scraper, points
are formed in place of the lines, which by further scraping
disappear entirely into white, by which means the transit into the
highest lights is effected. If a black surface is scraped with the
smooth knife a line tone is produced in the opposite direction to
the printed one. By the aid of the toothed scraper lines in any
desired direction can be obtained. When the printed tone is only
desired in parts in the picture, the other parts can be covered up
with white paper. The paper is only stuck down by the edges
with mouth glue; if it were stuck down all over with gum or starch
it would be distorted. On the white paper stuck on, drawing may
be done with the pen, and thus new effects again be obtained, as
thus in a manner pen and wash drawing are combined.</p>

<p>The white scraper boards without printed lines or dots are
either impressed with a single line or with lines crossed at right
angles.</p>

<p>On this paper pen and ink drawings combined with grained
tones may be done. The outlines and everything which is to be
treated like a pen drawing may be done with a hard pen or a
marten brush. Bright tones are so worked with the brush that
smooth surfaces are not formed, but dotted darker or lighter tones.
Those parts which have been laid on quite black can be brightened
up afterwards with the smooth or toothed scraper knife or the
needle, and thus many gradations obtained. Instead of the litho
writing ink pastell or very black good litho chalk may be used for
drawing. Obviously this paper also ought not to be washed or
smeared.</p>

<p>The pyramidal grain paper prepared by Schäuffelen of Heilbronn
is also very suitable for drawings for photo-lithographic reproduction.
The paper is coated with a chalk film of blinding
whiteness, and is stamped with a regular grain of truncated
pyramids, and is produced in three numbers. Grain No. 1 contains
2,500 regular projections per square centimetre; grain No. 2
contains 1,500; and grain No. 3, 750 pyramids.</p>

<p>This paper is drawn on with litho chalk or black pastell crayons.
The deepest shadows are laid on quite black, and light effects are
introduced with the scraper or engraving needle as with the
above described papers. The same rules apply to the other parts
of the drawing.</p>

<p>For drawing in general or the use of effects in drawing it should
be noted that with all these papers the drawing may be somewhat
overdone, and this is necessary in order to obtain the corresponding
vigorous action in the reproduction. The printing ink is, as a
rule, never such a deep black as the drawing ink, nor is the paper
which is used for printing ever so white as the lines of the toned
paper. The contrasts would, therefore, in
printing become too <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
little, and flat unsatisfactory pictures would be obtained. With
these drawings, therefore, the two opposites, “black and white,”
may be used to the extreme, even if the drawing is not satisfactory
to the artistic eye.</p>

<p>For making the drawing red paper ought not to be used, as
when photographed red appears dark. Then blue proof paper,
or paper rubbed with lead pencil, should be used.</p>

<p>A drawing for photographic reproduction ought never to be
rolled, and still less be folded; if it is to be sent away it should be
packed flat.</p>

<p>It is frequently required to make photo-lithographs of old
prints. As already mentioned in the introduction, we distinguish
three different methods of printing, of which the two first, typography
and lithography, are confined to the rendering of well-defined
lines or points, whilst copper-plate printing can to a
certain extent reproduce lines and tones. As regards the reproduction
of the first two, so far as their fundamental character
goes, no insuperable difficulties present themselves, when they
correspond at least to the general requirements of a drawing.
Since a reproduction, with exceptions, can never be better—obviously
without very complicated retouching—but always somewhat
inferior to the original, the appearance of the original will
always be some guide as to the quality of the reproduction that
can be produced.</p></div>

<p>If, however, prints are prepared specially for this purpose, the
following points should be observed:—</p>

<p>1. For printing a matt surface a so-called pure white chromo
paper should be used.</p>

<p>2. The ink should be black and of good body, the impression
clean and sharp, every line exact and not in the least fuzzy.</p>

<p>The expert lithographer will easily prepare his impression.
Assuming that he has a good original stone, he will more easily
make good and correct prints from the engraving from the chalk,
pen or other drawing than the typographer. The latter has to
give his impressions the correct finish by means of overlays,
without the correct making and use of which no good picture,
whether it be characters or a drawing, can be obtained actually on
a typographic press. The reader is referred to my article in
Professor Eder’s “Jahrbuch für Photo­graphie und Repro­duc­tions­ver­fahren”
for 1891, where I have treated of this at length. Prints
produced by the third method, copper-plate printing, give far
greater difficulties to the photo-mechanical worker. Every pull
from the engraved plate—etching scraper drawing and photogravure
excepted—possesses a tone on its surface, which is, moreover,
very unequal, and although increasing its artistic qualities,
offers, however, considerable difficulties for
reproduction. This can <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
only be avoided by very troublesome retouching, which is frequently
prejudicial to the beauty of the picture.</p>

<p>If pulls are specially prepared for reproduction the copper-plate
printer must very carefully polish his plate and print without a
tone, but still this must not be done so that the plate is too strongly
polished that the depths lose their vigour; this would give an
absolutely incorrect picture as regards gradation of tone.</p>

<p>Etchings can, as a rule, only be reproduced with the aid of a
cross-grained screen, and the same applies to photogravures,
although the latter will seldom be required.</p>

<p>All tone or painted originals, such as wash or sepia drawings,
photographs from nature, collotypes, photogravures, water-colours
and oil-colours can only be reproduced by photo-lithography by
the interposition of a screen when making the negative, or by a
process in which the breaking of the tone is effected independently
of the photographic negative, and which will be described later
on.</p>

<p>With old photographs which have faded it is as well to increase
the lights and shadows by painting.</p>

<div class="section">

<span class="smcap">R<b>EPRODUCTION.</b></span></h4>

<p>A question frequently asked is, “Of what size should a drawing
be made in order to obtain a good photographic reproduction?”
This question cannot be precisely answered, for a good deal
depends upon the object itself, and on the kind of drawing.</p>

<p>It may be generally said, however, particularly as regards pen
and ink drawings on smooth paper, that they should never be
smaller, only very rarely of the same size; they should be drawn
one-third or one-half larger generally. The artist can execute fine
details more easily and precisely on a large drawing than on a
small one.</p></div>

<p>The enlarged reproduction gives any faults or mistakes which
may happen to be in the drawing in proportionately larger size
quite independent of the fact that an enlarged reproduction is
always somewhat rough and ordinary. Reproduction in the same
size reproduces the faults the same size as they exist in the drawing;
the reduction, however, also reduces the failings of the
drawing if it cannot also absolutely remedy the same. The reduced
copy has always something finer and more delicate. The
degree of reduction must be kept in mind, and the drawing be
done with this in view.</p>

<p>If a drawing is executed very finely and full of detail, and,
besides that, contains very small lines of drawing or titles, they do
not gain in reduction, but the opposite; they lose, as much that in
the drawing appears plain and distinguishable becomes by strong
reduction indistinct and unrecognizable, or appears to the eye as a
tone. <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span></p>

<p>Individual cases, in which for specimen purposes or to show how
far reduction can go, many times linear, five, six, to ten times,
cannot be taken into consideration, although the effect is usually
well attained.</p>

<p>It should also be observed that the drawing must be considered
not only as regards its size, but also the strength of the lines and
tones generally for reduction; this specially applies as regards the
tones. By reduction the tone gradations are compressed, the picture
becomes poorer in tones, and although, theoretically considered,
light and shadow, that is to say black and white, are
actually distributed in the same ratio as in the original, yet the
reduced image appears proportionately darker and loses in artistic
effect.</p>

<p>Great reductions will, however, be useful when for some special
purpose such as the exact reproduction of geometrical figures or
surface ornaments are required, as for instance in printing designs
for cheques, bank notes, etc. In such cases the drawings should
be made as large as is necessary for the most exact and easiest
carrying out of the figures, as in this way the precision of the
drawing is better kept by reduction. In such cases, assuming that
the ornaments are clear and open without shading, the reduction
may be carried beyond one-tenth linear.</p>

<p>This kind of reproduction should present no difficulties either
to the reproduction or printing.</p>

<p>It is quite different, however, with drawings on scraper boards
or grained paper. If it is kept in mind that with too great reduction
the gradations of tone of the print will be destroyed, and that
in the same degree the difficulties of printing will be increased,
care should be taken that reduction is not carried too far. When
it is further considered that in a reproduction with 2,000 to 3,000
points to the square centimetre the individual points disappear to
the unaided eye, and the different thick layers of points appear as
closed tones, the limit of reduction will soon be found.</p>

<p>If we reckon according to this view, we can assume that those
kinds of paper with coarse grain should be reduced at the
most one-third, those with a finer grain a sixth, at the most a
fourth, in order to obtain good printing plates which will give
large editions. In this obviously will a good deal depend on the
character and more or less rich in detail execution of the drawing.
Still there are photo-lithographic processes such as the asphalt
process of Orell Füssli &amp; Co., which contains about 15,000 points,
and Bartös’ process, which contains 11,000 points to the square
centimetre; still for reproduction in large quantities these processes
offer many difficulties, and cannot therefore really be taken
into account when considering this.</p>

<p class="pcontinue"><span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span> arrangement
of the reproduction studio is essentially different
to that for ordinary portrait work. The general points of such
arrangements are described in detail in the handbooks of Drs.
Eder and Vogel, and these I may therefore omit so far as nothing
novel is to be observed.</p></div>

<p>We distinguish now between daylight and artificial light studios;
further, those in which a camera is used for making the negative
and those in which a dark-room itself is the camera. The first
will, of course, be used where other things besides reproductions
have to be made; the arrangement without a camera presents
many advantages for reproduction work only. In the arrangement
with artificial light the illumination of the object to be
taken is effected as a rule with a source of light which can
approximately replace daylight, and which also remains as constant
as possible, and the electric light is at present the best.
Although other sources of light are sometimes used, the electric
light in the form of the arc light for continuous practical use has
the advantage. For copying oil paintings daylight is to be preferred
under all conditions, and for this the best arrangement is
the revolving studio.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">1</a></p>

<p>The description of a modern studio with electric light as used
in the K.u.K. Militar-geographischen Institut in Vienna, and
from which the studio of the K.K. Hof-&nbsp;und Staatsdruckerei was
copied, is given here. This studio lies seven metres below the
level of the street on the south front of the building, and is shown
in Fig.&#xa0;2.</p>

<p>The preparation and dark rooms are illuminated with white,
yellow, and red light by means of two 50-c.p. incandescent electric
lamps for each colour, and besides this are provided with window
screens of glass of the same colours for daylight.</p>

<p>The windows open into an area 50 cm. wide which runs round
the building. The lighting is so arranged here that besides the
ordinary collodion plates, very sensitive gelatine plates can be
worked. The room C, where the original is
placed, is fitted up <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
with four Franzen arc lamps of 3,000 c.p. each for illuminating the
original, and the lamps are so arranged that the light falls
centrally on the original. The four lamps are fastened by ball</p>

<p class="phanga">B the developing room.</p>

<p class="phanga">C is the room in which the original is placed, where is found a support for the
original TT&#x2060;′, as is shown in Figs. 3 and 4.</p>

<p class="phanga">D is the dark-room with the focussing table EE&#x2060;′ (Figs. 2 and 3), and is separated
from C by a wall of 15 cm. thickness. In this wall is found the photographic
lens in a metal flange built into a stout iron box.</p>

<p class="phanga">F is the washing and polishing room for the glass plates.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">and socket arms to an iron frame which rests on rollers; they can
be raised or lowered on the frame, and for taking small objects
can be pushed closer together. The arms are fastened to the
round pillars of the frame, being provided with a screw grip.
The lamps can be placed as close as 0·5 m. to the original. As a
rule, however, they are worked at a distance of one metre, as then
the intensity of the light is about equal to diffused daylight. The
axes of the carbons in the lamps are so arranged that the glowing
crater formed in the positive pole is turned to the original, by
which means the illumination is intensified. The positive carbons
have a diameter of 20 mm., the negative carbons 8 mm. The
lamps stand in pairs one above the other at LL&#x2060;′. In the two
upper lamps the positive carbon is at the top and the negative
carbon below it, so that the light is equally distributed over the
whole of the subject. With this arrangement of the lamps all
reflections are avoided, and neither the grain of rough drawing
paper, the relief of an engraving, nor the edges of pieces stuck on
are felt. The current is produced by a dynamo in the house; it
enters into the place at N, whence it is divided into two circuits of
20 ampères, in which are two switches, an ammeter and a rheostat,
and the two lamps on either side.</p>

also the brick socle <i>aa</i> and <i>ee</i> (Fig. 2), on which

<p class="pcontinue">the
original and the focussing screen rest, run on rails, and
are absolutely isolated from the brickwork of the building in order
to avoid any possible vibrations.</p>

<p>The stand for the original TT&#x2060;′ is provided with screw fittings,
cams and wheels, which make it possible to raise the original, to
lower it, to move from right to left, and <i>vice-versâ</i>, vertically and
horizontally, so as to place its centre axial with the optical axis of
the lens, as well as parallel to the focussing screen in the dark
room. The whole of the mechanism lies at the back of the stand,
so that there is absolutely nothing in front of the original.</p>

<p>The focussing table EE&#x2060;′ is constructed in a similar manner to
the stand for the original, and is movable in every direction in
the same way. It carries in front two wood clips, in which the
board with the original is placed. The table for the original,
like the focussing table, is constructed on rollers, which run on
the already-mentioned rails. In order to be able to fix these as
soon as a sharp focus is obtained a brake is fitted. The placing of
the original table at the distance from the lens is accommodated
according to the size in which it is to be reproduced, and has
already been estimated. There remains, therefore, only to trouble
about the fine focussing, which is very quickly effected.</p>

<p>For taking line or wash drawings and for enlargements up to
80&nbsp;×&nbsp;80 cm. a Steinheil wide-angle aplanat is used, which gives no
distortion. The duration of exposure is with such subjects from
eight to ten minutes. For smaller subjects, and principally for
photographs on wood, an orthoscope by Voightländer is used, and
the exposure varies from four to six minutes.</p>

<p>A Zeiss anastigmat is used for making autotypes. Duration of
exposure from three to five minutes. Coloured objects, oil paintings,
etc., are taken in the daylight studio. They are printed in
the daytime in the open air, and in bad weather or under pressing
circumstances in the night by the electric light.</p>

<p>The negative for photo-lithographic work, for whatever method
it may be used, must before all things possess two principal
qualities; when looked through it should be as clear and as clean
as possible, on the other hand the ground as well covered as
possible. The deposit must not be of a black colour; from a well-drawn
original absolutely satisfactory negatives can be prepared
without the black colour. When a drawing is reduced which
contains grey lines, dots, and points, as well as full black ones,
toned lines will be visible as well as the transparent; with careful
treatment, the negative may be so far corrected that it may be
used. If this is not effected, or is not possible, the retouching
on the stone will be somewhat troublesome. The toned lines print
later than the transparent; these will
therefore be overprinted <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
when the former have scarcely reached the correct degree of
printing. The choice is then only left either to weaken the lines
which are too strong or to draw afterwards the faint or not
printed lines.</p></div>

<p>If the ground is not sufficiently opaque it will print through.
This can be remedied by intensifying the negative, or when this
is not possible to paint over it as well as possible.</p>

<p>Transparent spots are formed on the negative by an impure
silver bath or by dust flying about the room. These must be
spotted out if increased work later on on the stone or zinc plate is
not desired.</p>

<p>In reproducing fine copper engravings, it generally happens
that the fine grey hair-like lines and the light interstices, if the
plate was not properly polished, appear less transparent in the
negative than the other parts of the picture. In developing the
print the result is a partly broken image which can only be retouched
with considerable trouble. The negative can be corrected
by taking care to paint over the transparent parts. Professor
Husnik recommends, when the picture is not too large, to fasten a
transparent paper on the back of the negative, and to cover over
the glassy places with a soft lead pencil. These parts then print
simultaneously with the hair-like line and develop also equally.
If, however, the negative is large, and the picture very complicated,
a glass positive picture is prepared in the following manner: A
polished sheet of glass is levelled and coated with the following
solution:—</p>

<div class="dtablebox">

</table></div>

<p>When the solution has dried the glass plate is laid on the
negative and exposed till the deepest shadows have printed, and
it is then developed in water. When dry this glass positive is
laid on the back of the negative so that every part of each picture
fits. The plates are then bound round the edges with paper
strips so that they cannot shift. By this—although somewhat
troublesome—operation can an unsatisfactory negative be
rendered more even.</p>

<p>This correction can also be effected in the following manner:
The back of the negative is coated with raw collodion which
is faintly coloured with aniline red, eosine or fuchsine, allowed
to dry, and then with an engraving needle or a narrow knife
the less transparent lines may be scraped out, so that the red
collodion only remains on the transparent places. Obviously
also this can be done in the reverse, by painting a faint red
on the transparent places with a brush.</p>

<p>By this last method a tolerably extensive
retouching may be <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
effected on unequal negatives, which are the result of not quite
equally black or also very close drawn originals, from subjects
with very fine lines, such as copper-plate engravings, or from
finely-executed lithographs with very great reduction. Finally
it should be mentioned that with intelligent retouching any bad
negative can be used for photo-lithography, and the only question
now is whether it is not better to take the shortest way and
prepare a suitable negative when the original really permits of
its being done. In printing on chromated gelatine paper a good
result can be easier attained from somewhat foggy or thin
negatives than by printing with asphalt or other light sensitive
substance.</p>

<p>The following kinds of negatives are used for the various
photo-lithographic processes:—</p>

<p>For the transfer process with chromated gelatine paper or
direct printing on stone or zinc direct, a reversed line or autotype
negative.</p>

<p>For Orell and Füssli’s process, a reversed ordinary half-tone
negative.</p>

<p>For Bartös’ process and for photogravure on stone, a direct
ordinary half-tone negative.</p>

<p>The preparation and cleaning of the plate glass is as follows:—First
of all the plates are roughened with a piece of sharp pumice
stone on the extreme edges to the breadth of about 0·5 cm. in
order to prevent the frilling or floating off of the collodion film.
This is very little trouble considering the advantage it offers.
After being edged the plates are placed in a solution of</p></div>

must be done with absolute accuracy, and thus they make all

<p>The iron developer, with addition of sulphate of copper, is to
be preferred for short exposures to iron and lead developer. If
the plate has been correctly exposed the image gradually appears
after a short time, and very soon gets vigorous. When the details
appear in the deepest shadows the development must be immediately
stopped, otherwise fogging will ensue. If the image does
not gain vigour by long development it was under-exposed; with
over-exposure the image appears quickly and remains thin. The
developer, when fresh, works fairly quickly; older developers
work slower, but give very clear negatives.</p>

<p>For very fine line drawings or reproductions of copper-plate
engravings the developer is used somewhat weaker, and one-fifth
of its volume of water added. The development takes somewhat
longer; the fine lines remain, however, very clear.</p>

<p>After developing the plate is well washed and then intensified
first with a solution of—</p>

added. Care should be taken that in the first intensification
the glassy places remain clear. When, therefore, the desired
opacity is attained the plate should be immediately washed. Too
long intensification fogs the finer lines.</p>

<p>The plate should be fixed with 5 per cent. solution of potassium
cyanide. For this, however, a concentrated solution of hyposulphite
of soda can be used.</p>

<p>After well washing, the negative will show, when examined by
transmitted light, whether the ground is opaque enough, or
whether a further intensification is necessary. With correct
manipulation this first intensification will be sufficient for fine,
well-prepared drawings.</p>

well washing, the second intensification or blackening is effected
with a concentrated solution of mercuric chloride in distilled
water, which is allowed to act till there is a distinct precipitate

five minutes, when it is mixed with a third of its quantity of 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;30
solution of silver nitrate. The addition of a few drops of sulphuric
acid or 5 parts of citric acid is generally enough. This intensifier
acts somewhat more delicately than the silver and iron solution,
and has the advantage over the pyrogallol that it can be applied as
frequently as desired in full daylight to the fixed negatives without
any danger.</p>

<p>The negative must be fixed before intensification with hypo and
well washed.</p>

<p>A small quantity of solution A is poured over the negative to
drive off the water, and then it is intensified in the ordinary way
with 10 parts of solution A and 1 part of solution B.</p>

<p>Further intensification is effected, as described, with mercury,
the blackening with thiosulphate of gold.</p>

<p>When the negative is finished and dried it is coated with a
solution of gelatine 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;50, or a 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;15 solution of gum, in order to
protect the film, and the negative should be levelled and allowed
to dry.</p>

<p>Good opacity in the ground and clear glass in the lines of the
drawing are the fundamental requirements of a negative for photo-lithography.
But drawings are not always prepared in such a
manner that this can be completely obtained. With flat drawings
which are drawn in grey instead of black the first intensification
is only continued till the finest lines appear clear. For further
intensification the negative after drying is given a coating of a
light sensitive solution of—</p>

<p>Ammonia is now added till a light colour is formed. After
drying it is exposed from the glass side to 15° Vogel’s photometer,
washed for about a quarter of an hour and then soaked in warm
water till a relief is formed. By this operation a transparent relief
is formed on the lines of the drawing, which absolutely protects
the same from fogging. The intensification is then effected with
mercuric chloride and chloride of gold, or
an intensifier of <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
solutions of uranium and ferridcyanide is used, which is composed of
two solutions—</p>

<p>The negative is first flooded with the uranium solution and then
with the red prussiate.</p>

<p>Another process of intensification recommended by Prof. Eder
and Toth is the so-called lead intensifier.</p>

<p>The somewhat under-exposed negative ought only to be
developed with iron, fixed with hypo, and must then be well
washed. It is finally well rinsed with distilled water, and then
placed in a filtered solution of—</p>

<div class="dtablebox">

<p class="pcontinue">After a few minutes it becomes absolutely opaque in the covered
parts. The negative is allowed to remain in the bath till it has
attained the desired density. On the silver molecules of the
image a pale yellow precipitate has formed by the action of the
lead bath. The ferridcyanide of potash is reduced by the silver
to yellow ferrocyanide of potash, and gives then, with the lead
salt, an insoluble compound, ferrocyanide of lead. By the action
of ammonium sulphide the unstable lead salt is converted into a
stable salt.</p>

<p>As soon as the negative has been taken from the lead bath and
well washed, till the washing water no longer gives a blue precipitate,
it is flowed over with dilute ammonium sulphide 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;5.
Sodium sulphydrate may also be used. The image becomes black
instantaneously. The negative becomes generally vigorous; if,
however, it was exposed too long the fine hair lines and points veil
over very easily.</p>

<p>If the negative is not sufficiently intensified, which may happen
with very much under-exposed negatives, it should after well
washing, and before treating with ammonium sulphydrate, be
laid in a bath of—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">in which it
becomes still whiter, and should then be treated with
the ammonium sulphide. The lead, the cadmium, and the silver
of the bath are converted by the ammonium sulphydrate into
sulphide. The negatives treated with cadmium have a yellowish
tinge, whilst those treated with lead are
pure black. For <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
clearing up the white-lead image when it is too vigorous or is foggy
hyposulphite of soda or a dilute solution of potassium cyanide can
be used. This manipulation, however, requires great care. The
negative treated with ammonium sulphide if foggy can be cleared
up with hydrochloric acid, used weak and repeatedly poured on
and off, with careful watching of the action. After this it must
be well washed.</p>

<p>The lead solution will remain clear for weeks, and if it begins
to work slowly can be freshened up with addition of lead nitrate
and ferridcyanide of potash.</p>

<p>If stripping negatives are to be prepared, it is advisable, with
the lead intensified negatives, to give the glass plate a preliminary
rub with vaseline oil, to well wash, and then to coat with raw
collodion.</p>

<p>Husnik’s graphite intensification is still to be mentioned, which,
in some cases, may be of great service, but requires practice and
care.</p>

<p>The expert photo-mechanical worker will adopt one or the other
methods for his work, and as soon as he can work safely and without
hesitation he will adhere to that.</p>

<p>As regards the preparation of autotype negatives from simple
black originals—wash drawings—the above photographic processes
are quite sufficient. For taking painted originals—such as
oil paintings, water-colour drawings, fresco, and pastell drawings—an
orthochromatic collodion must be used if a correct
rendering of the tones in the negative is to be obtained.</p>
</div>

<p>In our studio we have obtained excellent results with two
kinds of colour sensitive collodion. These are the isochromatic
collodion emulsion prepared by Dr. E. Albert and that suggested
by Major von Hübl. In using the former, the glass plates as soon
as they are taken out of the acid bath and well washed must be
given a substratum of the following solution:—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">The solution should be filtered and coated whilst warm, and the
plate dried in a room free from dust at least 15° R.</p>

<p>For the production of the sensitiveness, or for the production
of the correct reproduction of the colours, two eoside of silver dyes,
R. and P., are used. The P. dye gives great sensitiveness, and is
especially suitable for portraits, landscapes, etc. In
using this a <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
correct reproduction of the red must be abandoned, whilst the R.
dye gives an absolutely correct colour rendering but requires
about double the exposure. Ten ccm. of the eoside of silver
solution are added to 100 ccm. of the emulsion. When coloured
the emulsion will only keep for one or two days.</p>

<p>The time of exposure with the R. dye is normally from one-and-a-half
to three minutes.</p>

<p>After exposure the plate must be well washed under a tap and
then allowed to thoroughly drain, or otherwise developing streaks
will show.</p>

Geographical Institute, in our establishment, and in the Photographic
Institute in Vienna have proved the advantageous use of
this method for orthochromatic work. The raw emulsion, according
to Hübl, is prepared as follows:—40 g. of silver nitrate
are dissolved in 50 ccm. of warm distilled water, and as much
ammonia added as will give a clear solution; then 100 ccm. of
alcohol are added and the whole allowed to cool. 30 g. of
ammonium bromide are dissolved in 35 ccm. of water and 70 ccm.
of absolute alcohol with gentle heat.</p>

<p>To make the emulsion 450 ccm. of four per cent. raw collodion
are placed in a strong glass flask which will hold a litre, and to
this in the dark room the silver solution added. Some of the
wool separates out, but by vigorous shaking this can again be
dissolved. A part of the silver salt also remains suspended in the
liquid in the form of fine crystals. The ammonium bromide is
added in three or four parts whilst warm. After shaking
thoroughly for several minutes the emulsion is precipitated by
distilled water, which is repeatedly added till the separation is
complete. The emulsion, which is now powdery, is placed on a
linen filter, washed several times with distilled water, squeezed to
press out the last of the water, damped two or three times with
alcohol, and then pressed. Whilst still damp with alcohol the
emulsion is dissolved in from 800 to 1,000 ccm. of alcohol and
ether, mixed with 0·5 grs. of codeine, and allowed to rest for some
days, when it will be ready for use.</p>

<p>The preparation of the eoside of silver solution is effected as
follows:—10 g. of yellow-shade eosine are dissolved in 250 ccm.
of boiling water and 5 grs. of silver nitrate in 50 ccm. of water
added hot. The solution is allowed to settle, then filtered, and
then washed first with boiling water and then with alcohol on the
filter, and then dried in a dimly-lighted room.</p>

<p>To prepare the dye solution 0·5 g. of the dry eoside of silver and
1 g. of ammonium acetate are gently heated together in 30 ccm.
of alcohol till dissolved, then 120 ccm. of alcohol and 10 ccm. of
glacial acetic acid are added, and the whole filtered. For plates
to be exposed wet, 5–10 ccm. of glycerine are added. The emulsion
is sensitized by adding one-tenth of its volume of dye, and
should be well shaken before coating the plates. The glass plates
should receive a preliminary substratum of gelatine or india-rubber,
so that the frilling of the film and impurities of the glass
plates may be totally avoided. <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span></p>

<p>For small sized plates the emulsion is used somewhat thicker
than for larger, and for the latter it should be diluted with alcohol
and ether. After coating they should be dried at about 15° C., and
then for some minutes exposed to a temperature of 30° C.</p>

<p>The plates should be developed with the following mixture:—25
g. of sodium sulphite should be dissolved in 40 ccm. of warm
water, then 10 g. of glycine added and 50 g. of potassium carbonate,
at first in small quantities in consequence of the evolution
of carbonic acid. When cool about 75 ccm. of a thin pasty
liquid will be obtained, which may be kept as a stock solution,
and before use must be well shaken and diluted with from 12–15
times the quantity of water. Wet plates should be washed before
development, and the developer flowed on; dry plates should not
be washed, and should be developed in a dish.</p>

<p>They should be fixed in sodium hyposulphite. The intensification
may be effected with metol (see p. <a href="#p039" title="go to p. 39">39</a>), and the blackening as
described on p. <a href="#p038" title="go to p. 38">38.</a></p>

<p>Obviously the collodion emulsion may be used for ordinary
work undyed.</p>

<p>Fig. 5 shows the arrangement in which the prism <i>a</i> is placed in
front of the lens <i>b</i>. The prism is three-cornered and the angle
turned to the objective is a right angle. The hypothenuse is
silvered. It is mounted in brass or nickel; on the mount is a
screw, by means of which it is fastened to the objective, so that
the side opposite to the hypothenuse lies upright to the side of the
camera, and this position must be an exact right angle to the
focussing screen. The camera itself must be absolutely horizontal.
The subject to be taken, instead of being in front of the camera,
is placed sideways to the prism. The image passes through <i>a&#x2060;′</i>,
falls on the silvered hypothenuse <i>a&#x2060;″</i>, from there through the
objective <i>b</i>, through the box-shaped extension <i>c</i> and the camera <i>d</i>,
on to the sensitive plate, which is not visible in the diagram.
The exposure with the prism is about
<span class="nowrap">1&#x2060;/&#x2060;5th</span> longer than usual,
because a portion of the light is absorbed by the prism.</p>

<p>Generally, for making reversed negatives of line drawings, it is
quite sufficient to place the sensitive plate the wrong way round
in the dark slide or in the carrier, so that the film side, instead of
being towards the objective, is turned towards the operator. It
is, of course, absolutely essential to use only glass plates which
are absolutely clean and which contain no particles of sand, air
bubbles, etc., which would show on the prepared negative as
points. After sensitizing the plate, the back of it must be
thoroughly cleaned, for any smudges or drops would be visible on
the negative. Obviously great care should be taken also in
cleaning the plate to make as little dust as possible. In the
Imperial and State Printing Works nearly all the reversed
negatives are prepared most satisfactorily in this way.</p></div>

<p>The photographic manipulations, the preparation, sensitizing
and developing of the plates, etc., is exactly the same as with
direct negatives.</p>

<span class="smcap">S<b>TRIPPING</b></span>
<span class="smcap">N<b>EGATIVES.</b></span></h4>

<p>There are various directions for making stripping negatives.</p></div>

<p>An india-rubber solution, consisting of equal parts of benzole and
chloroform, in which an equal part by weight of india-rubber is dissolved,
is used as a substratum. When the solution has become
quite clear, the unreversed and unvarnished negative is coated with
it. When the film is dry, a coating of raw collodion, to which some
drops of castor oil have been added, is given. When this film is
quite dry, it is cut through near the edges with a sharp knife, and
the glass plate and film placed in a dish filled with water, when
the negative film will loosen from the glass and after some time
will swim in the water. In this operation the use of force must
be avoided. The film is lifted from the water by
placing a card <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
underneath it, carefully dried with fibre paper, then laid flat and
pressed somewhat between tissue paper. The negative prepared
in this way has many disadvantages. First of all, the film is easily
injured, and, therefore, the edges should be bound with strips of
paper in order to protect it from tearing; further, the film is
easily folded and does not remain accurately of the same size,
which makes it useless for certain purposes. Moreover, this
process is somewhat costly. It is now almost entirely replaced by
a process in which a gelatine substratum is used.</p>

<p>This process is as follows:—The unvarnished negative is
accurately levelled with a level and coated 2 mm. thick with a
solution of—</p>

<div class="dtablebox">
<table summary="">

<p>The above quantity is quite sufficient for at least four negatives
21&nbsp;×&nbsp;26 cm. Many omit the acetic acid, but I have found that
it is an advantage for the slow drying, the pliability, and the keeping
of its size of the negative, to use acetic acid in moderate
quantities. To a certain degree the addition of glycerine also
effects this, but not sufficiently enough. Before pouring on the
gelatine solution, the plate must be absolutely dry. Any air bells
formed whilst coating must be pushed to the edge of the plate
with a piece of card. The plate must be dried spontaneously in
a room as airy and as free from dust as possible. In order to protect
the film from dust particles, it is advisable to give it a paper
cap or cardboard cover, which allows the access of air, and
obviously it ought not to touch the film.</p>

<p>When the gelatine film has become thoroughly hard, it should
be coated with negative varnish, and, after again drying, should
be cut round the edges with a sharp knife right through to the
glass and stripped from the plate.</p>

<p>If the glass was well-cleaned and prepared, as has been
previously described on page
<a href="#p041" title="go to page 41">41</a>, any gelatine film thus prepared
will well and safely strip without a substratum.</p>

<p>With dirty or old plates, a substratum of a 1–2% solution of
india-rubber should be used.</p>

<p>After stripping, the gelatine films are best kept between filter-papers
and under glass plates.</p>

or gelatine papers are articles of commerce and entirely fulfil their
purpose, and must before use be sensitized in a bichromate bath. In
establishments where much photo-lithographic paper is not used, it is
better to obtain it commercially from some reliable firm and not to
make it oneself, as this is somewhat troublesome, and requires special
appliances, some practice and experience, and with small consumption
does not pay.</p></div>

<p>For those who are interested in the preparation of chromated
gelatine paper I will now give the method, and I would remark that
this paper possesses all the necessary qualities for this process.</p>

<p>A sheet of well-sized paper is soaked in a bath of cold water, or
evenly damped with a clean pad, till it has become slimy. The
water is allowed to drain off, and then the sheet of paper placed on
a plate of glass which has been accurately levelled, and which
rests on a levelling stand with screws, so that it can be easily
levelled. By placing over it a sheet of blotting paper and squeegeeing
with an india-rubber or flannel squeegee the air bells between
the paper and glass are removed and any excess of water pressed
out. Then the edges of the sheet are bent up to about the depth of
2 cm., and wood or iron rods laid outside, and a warm 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;30 gelatine
solution poured on to it. A sheet 70 by 70 cm. will require
305 g., that is 7·5 g. of gelatine and 297·5 g. of water. The
gelatine will set in a few minutes, when the sheet is removed from
the glass and laid on a rack in a place free from dust to completely
dry, and should remain from a day and a half to two days.
Such gelatinized sheets can be kept in stock, and will keep fit for
use in a cool, dry place for from six to eight months. For this
purpose only good pure rag paper should be used, as the ordinary
cheap papers contain many additions which render them unsuitable
for this work.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h4 class="h4blk">(<span class="smmaj">A.</span>)
<span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">G<b>ELATINE.</b></span></h4>

<p>The gelatine must possess certain qualities, of which the principal
are as follows. Before all things it must be pure and free
from grease, or else small round pits form on the surface, which
give rise to troubles in developing and printing,
and only produce <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>
defective transfers. A large proportion of carbonic acid will produce
the same faults, which may, however, be remedied by a small
addition of ammonia shortly before use.</p></div>

<p>Gelatine is very hygroscopic, and therefore attracts moisture
from the room where it is kept and dissolves completely in warm
water. Even in very great dilution, <i>e.g.</i>, 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;100, it sets again to a
jelly in the cold, but loses the setting power after being repeatedly
warmed, or if the temperature was raised considerably higher than
was necessary to melt it. Damp gelatine decomposes in the air
very soon; the decomposition, however, can be delayed with
salicylic and carbolic acids and glycerine. Greasy gelatine can be
improved by the addition of 5 per cent. of alcohol. Too soft
gelatine can be hardened with chrome alum, and one part of
chrome alum may be used to 200 parts of gelatine, and by this
addition the melting point is raised about 7° C. Too hard gelatine
gives rise to the formation of bubbles. If the gelatine solution is
slightly acid it is not a disadvantage.</p>

<p>The gelatine used in our establishment is of French make, and
is known as “transparent white gelatine,” and is also very suitable
for collotype. I mention this because the gelatine frequently gives
rise to failure. For practical work, then, it is advisable to stick
to one make when it has been proved to be absolutely satisfactory.</p>

<p>To those who would study more closely this very important
material for photo-lithography and collotype, I would strongly recommend
the brochure “Ueber die Reactionen der Chromsäuren
und der Chromate auf Gelatine, Gummi, Zucker und audere Substanzen
organischen Ursprunges in ihrer Beziehung zur Chromatphotographie,”
by Professor Eder, in which the most exhaustive
information on the application of these two materials so important
in photography, gelatine and the chromate salts, is given in a
concise, popular, and easily understood form.</p>

<p>The sensitiveness to light of the different chromium compounds
forms at present the foundation of several photographic and photo-mechanical
processes.</p></div>

<p>According to Dr. Eder, Vauquelin discovered in the year 1798
chromium and chromic acid, and made at the same time the observation
that chromic acid formed with silver a carmine red salt,
which became purple-red by the action of light. In the year
1832 the philosopher Dr. Gustav Suckow, in his work, “Die
chemischen Wirkungen des Lichtes,” stated that the chromate
salts were also sensitive to light in the absence of silver if an
organic substance was added, as in the light lower (green) oxidation
products were formed. In 1839 Ponton added to Vauquelin’s
and Suckow’s discoveries, and discovered the photographic application
of chromate of silver, the light-sensitiveness of potassium bichromate
on paper. The chromates are <i>per se</i> stable in
light; in the <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
presence of organic substances, however, such as gelatine, albumen,
gum, etc., a quick reduction of the same takes place in light. Talbot
finally found that a mixture of gelatine and a chromate became
brown in light, and lost at the same time its solubility in warm water
and its power of swelling up in cold water. According to the same
authority simple potassium chromate is from 20 to 25 times less
sensitive to light than potassium bichromate, and the simple
ammonium chromate shows the same sensitiveness to light as
ammonium bichromate. For photo-lithography the latter salt,
potassium bichromate, is very important, and it has the chemical
formula of K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.</p>

<h4 class="h4blk">(<span class="smmaj">C.</span>)
<span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">G<b>ELATINIZING.</b></span></h4>

<p>The gelatinizing of the paper and the preparation of the gelatine
solution is effected as follows:—</p></div>

<p>The gelatine, accurately weighed out, is placed in small pieces in
the proper quantity of water, either in a large measure or some
other vessel, and placed in a water bath and immediately heated.
It is advisable to place the vessel containing the gelatine into the
water bath before the latter is heated, so that both may heat
together and fracture of the glass be thus avoided. When the
gelatine is completely dissolved the warm solution is filtered
through a linen filter, and so that it may not be cooled the vessel
into which the gelatine solution is filtered is also placed in the
water bath.</p>

<p>Whilst still warm and liquid the gelatine is poured on to the
previously prepared paper, and any bubbles of air brought to the
edge of the sheet with a strip of stiff paper or a feather.</p>

<p>It should be especially noted the gelatine solution should be
used up as quickly as possible or else it will deteriorate. Gelatine
which remains for a long time in a state of solution becomes soft
and fluid, and if the chromate bath is not well cooled a partial or
complete dissolving of the same takes place in sensitizing or later
in washing and developing.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h4 class="h4blk">(<span class="smmaj">D.</span>)
<span class="smcap">S<b>ENSITIZING.</b></span></h4>

<p>The first thing to be treated of is the preparation of the bichromate
bath. The necessary quantity of the bichromate of potash
is rubbed up as fine as possible in a porcelain mortar with a little
water; it should then be transferred to a larger flask and the
necessary quantity of water added. When all the bichromate is
dissolved the solution should be filtered, and so much ammonia
added as will convert the orange yellow colour into a straw yellow.
This bath can be kept, in a dark cool room, fit for use for a long
time. The proportions for the solution are—</p></div>

<div class="dtablebox">
<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">Potassium bichromate</p></td>

 <td><p class="tdpleft">parts</p></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="pcontinue" id="p050">and as
much ammonia as will make it straw coloured. The bath
is neutralized with ammonia or a soda or potassium salt, because
solutions of the bichromate salts have the property of dissolving
gelatine even in the cold.</p>

<p>The day before being used the sheet of gelatinized paper is
placed in this bichromate bath, which should be as cold as
possible; in summer it should be cooled with ice. It should be
completely immersed in this bath, so that the solution covers every
part of the sheet to the depth of 1–2 cm., and should be left in it
about three minutes; care must be taken that no air bells form on
the gelatine. If this should happen they should be removed with
a soft brush, which ought not to be used for any other purpose.
On the places not covered by the bichromate solution, which has
been kept off by the air bells, the paper would not be sensitive to
light.</p>

<p>For ordinary printing the paper may be dried in the air by
placing it on a board, or better on a rack; for better class work,
and actually for all work, it is better to squeegee the paper
as soon as it is removed from the bichromate bath on a sheet of
plate glass which has been well cleaned and polished with talc,
the excess of solution or any air bubbles being removed by
squeegeeing thoroughly under blotting-paper. Many operators
slightly grease the glass plate. I have found that this is not
necessary if a sufficiently cold sensitizing bath is used, the plate
glass thoroughly cleaned and well rubbed with talc, and it is dried
in an airy room. It is advisable to see that there is always ventilation
in the drying room, and the more this is done the better the
paper will behave in the subsequent operations.</p>

<p>To completely dry, the paper requires when drying by itself
from three to four hours; from ten to twelve hours when squeegeed
to glass. The best way is to sensitize the paper in the afternoon
or the evening, so that it may be used the next day in the morning.
The paper when sensitized will, when properly kept in a
dark cool room, be in a fit state to use for several days. By
squeegeeing on to the plate glass the paper takes a very high
glossy surface, and thus in printing comes into intimate close
contact with the negative. In exposing, therefore, every fine line
appears with greater precision than on paper which has become
wrinkled and uneven, and which has not been previously glazed.
It should also be mentioned that this gloss is frequently obtained
by burnishing the sensitized paper when dry.</p>

<h4 class="h4blk">(<span class="smmaj">E.</span>)
<span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>RINTING.</b></span></h4>

<p>After the paper has been sensitized and well dried it is printed.</p></div>

<p>The negative is first laid in the printing frame film side up.
Then the paper is laid with the sensitive yellow side on the negative,
and the frame closed. Before it is placed in
the light, care <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
should be taken to see that the paper lies closely everywhere on
the negative, otherwise it will in parts be indistinct, and the print
be useless. For estimating the correct exposure a photometer
should be used, and I take as an example Vogel’s Fig. 6.</p>

<div class="dctr03">
<img src="images/i051.png" width="800" height="326" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">Fig. 6.</div></div>

<p>When beautiful clear negatives are used they should be printed
to 14 to 16 degrees Vogel. Obviously no strict instructions can be
given for every case, and it will be dependent on the quality of the
negative and the object.</p>

<p>If the negative has to be covered, or any other dodge used, the
time of exposure must of course be arranged accordingly. As a
general guide it may be stated that the details of the picture
should appear brown and distinct from the ground when the print
has been correctly exposed. This examination of the picture must
be done in a dark room, and only one side of the printing frame
should be opened, so that the print does not shift. If it is over-printed,
the picture develops badly, the lines become broader, the
details disappear in the deep shadows, and the ink adheres to the
unexposed parts. If, on the contrary, it is under-printed, the ink
does not adhere well to the exposed places, and washes off in
developing from the fine parts. Practice, as with all manipulations,
is necessary, and therefore one must not be disheartened by the first
failure.</p>

<p>As soon as one is satisfied that the exposure is sufficient, the
print should be taken from the frame in the dark room. The
next process is inking up and developing. This is effected in
various ways; the ink is either spread on the dry print with a
velvet roller or a thin developing ink is used with a brush, or the
bichromate is first washed out and then the ink spread on. I
prefer to ink up the print with a velvet roller, on which is the
developing ink, before washing. By this method I obtain between
ink and gelatine the soluble chromium film. The print develops
then very quickly and well. For this purpose it is laid on a glass
plate, a litho stone or any other flat surface, a small quantity of
good litho transfer ink is distributed on an inking stone with an
ordinary litho roller, and the velvet roller charged
with the ink <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
from the stone by rolling it several times over the stone. The
print is now rolled up with the velvet roller till it appears of a
general grey tone; the details of the picture, however, are still
visible through the ink. With this first inking up, too little
rather than too much ink should be used. When the inking up
is finished, the print should be laid in cold water, care being
taken that no air bells form on the surface, and it is also advisable
to frequently turn the paper over once or twice in the water.
After ten or fifteen minutes a change will be seen on the print,
the exposed parts will be somewhat more depressed than the unexposed,
which will have swollen to some extent in the water.
The print is now taken out of the water and spread out exposed
side up on a sheet of glass, very carefully avoiding folds, and
dried with blotting paper, and the water which is on the back of
the print is removed by strong pressure on the print from the
front.</p></div>

<p>The print whilst still damp is again for a second time rolled
up with the velvet roller, by which means the details of the
drawing again take the ink. From the unexposed parts the ink
now goes on to the roller, in exactly the same way as in cleaning
the litho stone, and they appear covered now with a very faint
tone. If the first rolling up was done with too much ink, it will
be accompanied by two disadvantages. Firstly, that too much
ink will adhere to the details of the drawing, and there will be
the danger that in transferring the same will appear thick, and
secondly the tint will not be so well removed from the unprinted
parts, which will produce a difficult development. It is therefore
advantageous only to give in the second inking the printed parts
the quantity of ink requisite for transfer.</p>

<p>After being inked up a second time the print is again placed
for a short time in the water, then taken out, spread out on the
sheet of glass, and now completely developed with a pad or a
tuft of cotton wool. This is effected by going over all the print
with light pressure and not too quickly with a circular movement,
till the drawing appears quite clear and clean on a white
ground. In this operation it is advisable to use as much water
as possible, in order to remove all the bichromate from the print,
which might be troublesome in the subsequent operations. The
washing should not therefore be stopped till the unexposed parts
have lost all yellow tinge and appear nearly white. If the
bichromate remains in the unexposed parts, the process continues
during the drying of the print; these places then become hardened,
and are frequently the cause of an unsatisfactory transfer. <i>One
of the chief requisites is, however, that too much ink should not be used
in inking up. The developed drawing should not appear deep black,
but grey, yet covered in all places.</i> The developing ink contains so
large a quantity of grease that the least quantity is sufficient to
form the combination previously described
on the stone. <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span></p>

<p>The developed print is freed from all adhering water by pressure
with half-damp blotting-paper, and then fastened on to a
board with drawing pins to completely dry.</p>

<p>The room where the development is carried on should be well
ventilated, and not be heated too much, as the latter makes the
work more difficult. The drying ought not to be forced and
should be allowed to take place spontaneously at the ordinary
temperature of the room.</p>

<p>For transfer to zinc and for sending photo-lithographic prints
it is advisable to bathe them in a 10 per cent. solution of alum for
about five minutes, so that the gelatine film is hardened. When
the prints are to be used or to be transferred to stone immediately
this treatment may be omitted without harm.</p>

<p>The paper described above is a pure gelatine paper, and
although this has proved in practice to be satisfactory for all
work that may arise, still I will describe some other papers,
which have been also used in practice with good results, and for
those who do not care to prepare their own paper they have the
advantage that they may be obtained commercially.</p></div>

<p>Albumen was used first instead of gelatine and rendered sensitive
by the addition of a chromium salt. This paper had the disadvantage
that it could not be kept, and only sufficient paper and
albumen solution for one day’s work could be prepared. A much
greater disadvantage, however, was that in developing, the
albumen film was rubbed off with the pad, and the paper was
more or less rubbed up. A tint was produced through this
which transferred to the stone, and thus gave rise to considerable
troublesome and tedious retouching. This is not the case, however,
with the gelatine coating, which is comparatively more resistant.</p>

<span class="smcap">H<b>USNIK’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>HOTO-LITHOGRAPHIC</b></span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>APER.</b></span></h4>

<p>Prof. Husnik has combined these two processes for the production
of his papers, as he gives a coating of albumen to a paper
coated with gelatine, which should be rendered sensitive with
ammonium bichromate. By this means is, on the one hand, the
rubbing up of the paper prevented and damage to the image not
easily possible; on the other hand, the development takes place
very quickly, as the albumen film dissolves and can be easily
removed with the greasy ink. Husnik specially contends that
with the use of these papers he obtains extraordinarily sharp
images without any tint. The sheets thus prepared will only keep,
however, one or two days, and this inconvenient operation has to
be repeated every time before using the paper. This applies also
to the albumen solution, so Husnik has come to the conclusion that
it is better and more practical to use plain
gelatine paper; but <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
when trouble, time, and cost are not of such great consideration,
then it is better to use the paper with the compound coating, as it
enables less experienced operators to produce good work.</p></div>

<p>The paper more recently produced by Husnik is a pure gelatine
paper, which is rendered sensitive to light in—</p>

</table></div>

<p class="pcontinue">As much ammonia
is added to the bichromate solution as will convert
the reddish colour into yellow, and the bath smells of
ammonia. The bathing of the paper must be done as quickly as
possible, and the sheet should only be drawn through the solution.
The exposure for this paper is from one to three minutes in the
sun, or from ten to thirty minutes in diffused light.</p>

<p>The inking up of the print should be done with a greasy transfer
ink, to which one-sixth part of wax has been added, and the whole
dissolved in turpentine to the consistence of oil. The print is
inked up with this thin ink, and then gone over with a pad of
cotton wool till it has taken an even gray tint.</p>

<p>When the turpentine has evaporated the print is laid in cold
water, and, after about ten minutes, developed with a soft thick
pad with a continuous circular movement and quite light pressure.
After development all adhering water is removed from the print
with damp blotting-paper, and the transfer can be effected after
from fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Husnik, however, did not rest, and soon prepared a still better
paper, which is known at the present time commercially as
“Husnik’s Autotypic Paper.” He produces this paper in large
quantities, the coating of the gelatine being effected by machines,
which certainly tends to ensure equality.</p>

<p>Husnik found that by the use of less concentrated bichromate
baths the fine lines were stronger after printing than from the
nature of the negative they should be. From one and the same
negative there was obtained by the use of a bichromate bath of
1&#x202f;:&#x202f;100 a relief five times as broad as when a bath of 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;15 was used
to sensitize the paper. This he ascribes to the colour of the
gelatine being less, so that more rays of light penetrated to the
surface of the paper, from which it would be again reflected, and
every point or line again reproduced, which must obviously lead to
an increase of the size of the same; on the other hand, with
strongly chromated paper, the rays of light would not only be
absorbed by the intense yellow colour of the chromium salt, but
still more by the brown tone formed immediately after printing,
which makes a reflection impossible. With autotype negatives
this is specially striking, as with weakly-chromated paper black
shadows without details occur, because here the quantity of light
is distributed by reflection over the fine points,
and they will <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
therefore become thicker. When using strongly-chromated papers
the details in the shadows appear open, clear, and sharp.</p>

<p>The concentration of the bichromate bath cannot be increased at
will, because other disadvantages are produced, especially such a
firm adherence of the greasy ink to the print that it transfers
badly and a part of it always remains behind. The bichromate
salt, when as strong as 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;18, dissolves the gelatine at ordinary
temperatures, and the baths, neutralized with ammonia, have the
disadvantage that the greasy ink adheres too little to the print
and will be rubbed away in developing the drawing. In order to
entirely obviate the reflection of the rays of light Husnik uses an
addition to the gelatine besides a 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;22 acid bichromate bath, which
produces a pure yellow tone in sensitizing the papers, is insoluble,
and completely penetrates the film of gelatine, so that a reflection
of the chemically active rays is entirely avoided.</p>

<p>This paper, which is also darker coloured, does not allow the
light rays to pass through, and is specially suitable for the transfer
of autotypes to stone or zinc.</p>

<p>For sensitizing this paper bichromate of potassium, sodium, or
ammonium is used, but the sodium salt has acted the best.</p>

<p>In winter a 1 to 20 bath is best; in summer, 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;22 or 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;24. The
treatment of the paper, as well as of the print, is exactly the same
as with other transfer papers. The bath will keep for fourteen
days. Caustic ammonia ought not to be used.</p>

<p>A photo-lithographic paper, with which I have obtained very
good results on stone as well as on zinc, with all kinds of drawings,
is sold by A. Franz.</p></div>

<p>This is also a pure gelatine paper. But Franz adds to the gelatine
solution manganese sulphate (this must not be confounded with
manganese borate, siccative powder, which makes the transfer ink
dry so quickly that a transfer to the stone or zinc is impossible).</p>

<p>Through the researches of MM. Lumière the manganese salts
have gained considerably in importance, and they have been introduced
into photo-mechanical processes. When an addition of
about 10% of manganese sulphate is made to the acid bichromate
baths for sensitizing photo-lithographic papers, the printed places
assume a very much darker colour, which is an advantage in
judging the print, in developing the finest lines, and points are
retained much more easily than on paper sensitized with the
addition of ammonia.</p>

<p>This paper possesses the advantage, which is also more important,
that the—especially in summer—unpleasant ammonia bath
need not be used. The paper is sensitized in a solution of—</p>

<div class="dtablebox">
<table summary="">

<p>Ammonium bichromate ought not to be used. The bath would
then become cloudy immediately, and both bath and paper made
useless.</p>

<p>When sensitized the paper can be kept from eight to ten days
without losing its good qualities.</p>

<p>With this a transfer ink is supplied in tubes, which must be
mixed with an equal volume of turpentine and benzine, so that
it becomes quite fluid. The print, when it is taken from the frame,
is fastened on a board with drawing pins, and with a fine camel’s
hair brush coated with this fluid ink as evenly as possible, and just
so much that a light grey tone is formed on the print. This paper
must not be inked up with a roller. As soon as the turpentine
and benzine have evaporated the print is laid in cold water, and
after about ten minutes developed with a clean tuft of cotton wool.
The print does not show a strong relief; the development takes
place quickly and regularly. The ink, in spite of its being so thin,
is very greasy, so that only a very light skin is necessary for the
subsequent transfer. The tint produced by a negative slightly too
thin cannot be easily removed.</p>

<p>The other operations are the same as for the other photo-lithographic
papers.</p>

<p>Franz’s photo-lithographic paper is characterized, as already
mentioned, by giving extraordinarily sharp clean transfers, which,
indeed, maybe due to the use of the very thin liquid greasy ink. It
is, therefore, especially to be commended for very fine work.</p>

<p>August Albert’s is also a very good photo-lithographic paper.
It can be obtained commercially in two qualities, viz., “Photo-lithographic
paper” and “Autotypic high glaze paper.” This has
been tested in the K.K. Lehr-&nbsp;und Ver­such­sanstalt für Photographie
und Repro­duc­tions­ver­fahren in Vienna, and has received
a cer­tif­i­cate of excellence. The high glaze paper has a prepared
film of several coatings; the developed prints when dry keep the
high glaze.</p></div>

<p>The sensitizing bath consists of—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">and to this
so much ammonia is added as will convert the reddish
colour into a light yellow; a small excess of ammonia does no
harm. The bichromate bath should not have a lower temperature
than +15° R, or else the solution cannot penetrate the film
sufficiently, which results in a defective development. The duration
of sensitizing is from four to eight minutes, till the paper is
quite soft and damped through. It is preferable to sensitize too
long rather than too short. <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span></p>

<p>The paper should be squeegeed on to plate-glass, as already
described, and allowed to dry spontaneously. The paper when
stripped from the plate-glass shows a beautiful high glaze, and can
be kept fit for use for twenty-four hours. When the paper is older
it can still be used, but the development is more difficult, and it is
better to avoid this for fine drawings or autotypes.</p>

<p>Albert does not recommend a photometer to be used when
printing this paper, but by examination of the print to judge
when this is correct. The image should have a brown tone, and
be easily distinguished by the eye from the ground. Over-printing
is disadvantageous, as the lines and points become broader, the
prints develop badly, the tint adheres firmly to the ground, and
the details in the deepest shadows are lost.</p>

<p>The inking and developing can be done by any of the known
processes which is thought desirable. The chief thing is that too
much ink must not be used in the first inking up; any intensification
required may be effected with a second coating. This is,
especially for fine drawings and autotypes, very important, whilst
for coarser work also once inking is sufficient. The prints are then
placed in cold water, and after sufficient washing should be
developed with a soft pad or pad of wool, with which any tint can
be very easily removed from any parts which should remain white.</p>

<p>The transfer from the bichromated gelatine paper requires
generally, as regards treatment and choice of the material, greater
care on the part of the printer than an ordinary transfer, and this
increases in transferring fine drawings or autotypes on to stone.</p></div>

<p>In the first place the good quality of the stone should be looked
to. For ordinary or coarsely drawn subjects this is of less importance,
but for fine drawings and autotypes it is of the highest
importance. Further, accuracy and cleanliness are all important,
without which successful work is impossible. On the other hand,
a transfer can hardly fail if it be accurately and correctly performed.</p>

<p>When the print comes from the developing bath, and has been
well washed so that every trace of bichromate is removed, it should
be freed from excess of water between blotting-paper. It should
then be dried in a not too warm place free from dust till the
gelatine has completely set and feels absolutely dry. The relief
will have now again disappeared, and the black and white places
lie in the same plane. It is best dried by pinning it to a board
with drawing pins, and then set up in a dry place.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the transfer stone should be prepared, which
must be absolutely faultless. Just before the transfer it should
be dry polished with pumice stone, and then well
dusted with a <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
cloth. The slightest grain will give a spot in a fine tone.
Obviously the stone must be well ground so that neither any
spots nor lines of an earlier transfer can appear. With an open
drawing this can be corrected, but not with an autotype; in such
a case the shortest way is to make a new print and a new transfer.</p>

<p>The print is first wiped over on the back with a damp cloth, and
then laid on damp blotting-paper. After about five minutes the
print is treated a second time with a damp cloth, and then laid
between damp blotting-paper. It is not advisable to lay the print
between ordinary damp blotting-paper, as the gelatine becomes
somewhat sticky, and would attract particles from the rough
paper.</p>

<p>The degree of dampness which is necessary for transfer may be
judged in that the print must feel soft, but the gelatine film ought
not to be very sticky. Any further preparation of the print before
transferring to the stone is not necessary. The print is laid on the
stone, over it a dry sheet, and then the cover, and then drawn
through the first time with light pressure.</p>

<p>In order to prove whether the transfer has taken well a corner
may be lifted up. All the ink which was on the print must be
transferred to the stone, and then the transfer has been completed
in the correct way. The print is now pulled off the stone and the
transfer made ready, like any other.</p>

<p>With this method of treatment the print will strip easily, which
is not the case if it was not well dried after the developing bath;
a much sharper and cleaner transfer will also ensue. If the print
was too damp a fuzzy, broken-down transfer will be obtained,
because the gelatine, which has become too soft, will be broken
down.</p>

<p>I will also mention that it is not advisable to treat fine drawings
or autotypes with the rubbing-up pad. It is better to go over the
transfer with the roller, and the tones are kept cleaner. The stone
is then gummed, placed on one side, and allowed to stand some
hours before being etched.</p>

<p>For transferring to zinc plates which are to be etched or to be
printed from, the bichromated gelatine print should be bathed in a
ten per cent. solution of alum, allowed to dry, and then, as
previously described, damped, and then transferred under the
same conditions as to stone.</p>

<p>It only remains to mention that the stone or zinc plate should
not be too cold.</p>

<span class="smcap">T<b>RANSFERS.</b></span></h4>

<p>The failures or faults which are met with in photo-lithographic
transfer may be caused by various things.</p></div>

<p>The squashing down rarely happens with photo-litho transfer,
because a good photo-lithographic paper will
bear a considerable <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
amount of dampness. When, however, it occurs it may be assumed
that either too strong pressure or insufficient care in the setting of
the stone is the cause. Much more frequently it happens that
some parts of the print do not transfer at all, or only in a defective
manner. The chief reason of this is that the print was insufficiently
damped. This frequently happens if ordinary or gravure prints
are to be transferred with photo-lithographic prints. If the printer
encloses the impression on the ordinary transfer paper and the
photo-lithographic together in the same damp sheet, and if he
estimates the degree of dampness from the gravure print, the
photo-litho paper will be insufficiently damped and a good transfer
will not be obtained from the latter. If, however, he waits till the
photo-litho paper is damp enough, the other impressions will be too
damp and will squash out in transfer. For such work the print
on ordinary transfer paper and the photo-lithographic print should
be kept separate, so that the different dampness requisite for each
can be regulated.</p>

<p>Another case which frequently happens is that the print is
contaminated with particles of dust or other foreign substances.
These may be flying about in the air or be on the stone, the roller,
or the damping paper. Through this many transfers of fine
drawings are rendered useless. Perfect cleanliness of the utensils
and the use of the correct ones, combined with a drying-room for
the print absolutely free from dust, are absolutely essential for
faultless work.</p>

<p>The composition of the ink, especially if it was too hard, may
give rise to bad transfers.</p>

<p>Photo-lithographic papers, which are prepared with very hard
gelatine, must be laid before transferring in lukewarm water. By
this means the hard gelatine becomes rather sticky, and the greasy
ink transfers much better. Even those points which in developing
have taken up little ink, and appear grey, transfer completely to
the stone and adhere firmly.</p>

<span class="hsmall">
PHOTO-LITHOGRAPHY BY DIRECT PRINTING ON TO STONE OR ZINC.</span></h2>

<p>The processes of photo-lithography previously described are based
upon the printing on to bichromated gelatine or albumen paper
development with a greasy ink and subsequent transference of
the greasy print to plate or stone. A process may also be used in
which the stone or plate is printed on direct. There are in this
various methods, of which the principal are printing on to light-sensitive
asphalt, or an organic substance, gelatine or albumen, in
combination with a bichromate salt. The reason is the high
sensitiveness, which is possible, of the substances used.</p></div>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3 class="h3blk">1. THE ASPHALT PROCESS.</h3>

<h4 class="h4blk">(<span class="smmaj">A.</span>) <span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">L<b>IGHT</b>-S<b>ENSITIVE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>SPHALT.</b></span></h4>

<p>Light-sensitive, or so-called Syrian, asphalt, which is prepared
for photo-lithographic and photo-zincographic purposes, can be
obtained from various firms who deal in photographic goods, and
one has only to dissolve the same according to the prescribed
directions. This kind of asphalt is, however, not very sensitive,
and in use must be printed for some considerable time. If, therefore,
an asphalt of greater sensitiveness is desired it is not sufficient
to merely dissolve Syrian asphalt, but it must undergo a preliminary
preparation.</p></div>

<p>Only that part of the asphalt is sensitive or useable for photo-lithographic
work which does not dissolve in ether. The insensitive
part must, therefore, be separated out, which is done by
finely powdering the asphalt, sifting it through a fine sieve, and
then treating it with ether. All that is soluble in ether goes into
solution; the marc which is not soluble in ether is then dissolved
in benzole and used as wanted.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h5 class="h5blk">(<i>a.</i>) <span class="smcap">H<b>USNIK’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>ROCESS.</b></span></h5>

<p>Professor Husnik has improved this process in so far that he
does not dissolve the asphalt powder in ether, as, according to his
view, a complete solution of all the insensitive portion is not
attained by this process, but he dissolves coarse asphalt powder
completely in rectified spirit of turpentine to the consistence of a
moderately-thick syrupy mass, until no hard particles or a residue
are contained in the solution. To this viscous asphalt solution a
plentiful quantity of ether is added gradually, and with constant
stirring, and a big flask should be used for this purpose. After a
sufficient quantity of ether has been added
a pitch-like deposit <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span>
separates out at the bottom. In order to test whether there is
still any light-sensitive asphalt in the supernatant liquor a small
quantity is poured into a glass and mixed with ether, when if a
precipitate ensues more ether must be added to the big flask.</p></div>

<p>After standing for about twenty-four hours the ether contains
all soluble insensitive constituents of the asphalt; the pitch-like
residue in the flask, after pouring off the solution, is again treated
with ether, so that all turpentine is extracted and any stray insensitive
particles are dissolved. The pitchy residue is now removed
from the flask and allowed to stand in a porcelain dish in a warm
place, with frequent stirring, till it is quite freed from ether, and
has formed a hard, brittle, black shining substance, which can be
easily broken up into powder with the hand. This product is now
the light-sensitive asphalt, which is dissolved for use in anhydrous
benzole. As benzole is only to be obtained anhydrous with
difficulty, some chloroform is added to the solution in order to
prevent the running together in drying, whence the film would
become unequal and patchy.</p>

<p>The coating of the stone or plate with the asphalt film is very
simple; it should be placed horizontal, and then whirled rapidly
on a whirler.</p>

<p>Printing under a clear negative takes from a quarter to half an
hour in direct sunlight.</p>

<p>The picture is developed with turpentine.</p>

<p>Valenta recommends for photo-lithography asphalt which has
been sulphurized by the wet process, as it possesses a considerably
higher light-sensitiveness than that which is not sulphurized.<a

<p>The process is as follows:—100 g. of raw Syrian asphalt are boiled
in a retort with an equal quantity of raw pseudo-cumene, which has the
formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and
a boiling-point of about 170° C., with 12 g. of flowers of sulphur,
which should have been previously dissolved in the pseudo-cumene. When
after about three or four hours’ boiling the evolution of sulphuretted
hydrogen has ceased, the pseudo-cumene is distilled off and the black
pitchy residue dissolved in benzole in the proportion of 4&#x202f;:&#x202f;100, and
used for the preparation of the plate or stone.</p>

<p>The sulphurized asphalt prepared in this way is almost insoluble
in ether, but dissolves fairly readily in benzole, toluene, xylene,
cumene, and turpentine, and is very sensitive to light.</p>

<p>With this asphalt good prints are obtained even in bad,
cloudy weather. For use four parts of the sulphurized asphalt
are dissolved in 100 parts of benzole, the solution filtered and
diluted till a thin film on a zinc plate shows a golden yellow colour.
Exposure of the asphalt solution in an open flask for from half to
one hour in sunlight is advisable.</p>

<p>For developing the asphalt image rectified oil
of turpentine free <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
from acid is used; the best is French or Austrian. The development
may be accelerated by adding Hungarian or Russian turpentine,
which, however, attack the asphalt image; it can be restrained
by the addition of ligroin, benzine, or wood oil to the turpentine.</p>

<p>Zinc plates are best developed in a dish, stones by making a wax
margin round the drawing. The oil of turpentine is poured on
and rocked to and fro. Rubbing with a pad of cotton wool, etc.,
should be avoided. After development the plate should be well
washed under a stream of water, and before gumming, the plates
should be exposed for some time to light, as this makes the ground
more resistant to the etching.</p>

<p>The solution must be thin, so that it flows over the stone well
and does not form unequally-covered patches.</p>

<p>The subsequent manipulations must be conducted in the dark.</p>

<p>The stone which is to be used must be well ground, and polished
with dry pumice stone, well dusted, and be absolutely flat. It
ought not to have any depressions, as the negative would not lie
in contact there. The places would not print sharp, and therefore
a bad result would be obtained.</p>

<p>The necessary quantity of the solution is now poured into the
middle of a well-polished stone, and distributed as evenly as
possible by rocking backwards and forwards. When thoroughly
distributed the stone should be placed on the whirler and kept for
some time in motion. The asphalt solution must be as thin as
possible, so that it appears yellowish-brown and the colour of the
stone appears through it. If the stone is only covered all over the
film can be very thin; on the other hand, if it is too thick it will
not print through, and will develop badly, as too much of the
asphalt will dissolve. If zinc plates are used for printing they
should be prepared as previously described on p. <a href="#p006" title="go to p. 6">6.</a> Zinc plates
for deep etching must be well ground and well polished, and
ought not to repel water. The zinc plates are coated the same as
the stone.</p>

<p>When the film is absolutely dry, which will be in about fifteen
minutes, printing may be proceeded with. For this purpose the
negative is either laid on to the asphalted stone, film side down,
and pressed down with screw bands, or it is laid, the glass downwards,
in a specially-constructed and very strongly-built printing
frame, which is provided with a sheet of plate
glass, and the <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
asphalted side of the stone laid on this, the printing frame closed,
and then exposed to light. The exposure continues according to
the strength of the light and the nature of the negative from 15
minutes to 1½ hours. If the film of asphalt be thin and the
negative clear it may be printed to 18 or 20 degrees in Vogel’s
photometer. This kind of printing always requires some experience,
as various factors, such as the thickness of the asphalt film, the
density of the negative, also the fineness of the drawing, have to
be taken into account. It will be understood that the asphalt
film must always be coated as evenly as possible.</p></div>

<p>If it is printed too long the stone will not develop at all, or only
in parts; if it is printed too little the drawing wholly or partially
dissolves. In both cases an unsatisfactory result will be obtained.
Negatives very clear in the lines of the drawing, and well covered
in the ground, are here more essential for success than with the
chrome gelatine process.</p>

<p>When properly printed the frame and the stone should be
brought into the dark room and development proceeded with.
For ordinary Syrian asphalt rectified turpentine can be used, and
one of two methods may be adopted. The stone is laid in a pan as
straight as possible, and then flowed over with turpentine, which
should be allowed to remain on it for some time, and then poured
off into the pan. Fresh turpentine is now applied till the drawing
appears clear and distinct. The turpentine which is allowed to
run off can be used for washing purposes. An edging of warm
gutta-percha may also be made round the drawing, and then
turpentine poured on to it and the stone rocked up and down till
the drawing is developed.</p></div>

<p>The very sensitive kinds of asphalt of Husnik and Valenta are
much more readily soluble than the ordinary Syrian asphalt. In
developing one must go carefully to work, and not allow the
turpentine to stay on the stone a long time, but to pour it over the
stone, which should be inclined so that it can run off. This can
be repeated if required. It can be well and safely developed if
half and half of turpentine and linseed oil is used, which, however,
has the disadvantage that the stone becomes greasy, but this
can be taken off by the expert printer.</p>

<p>After developing the stone should be well washed under a strong
stream of water, then allowed to dry in the light, as by this the
asphalt film becomes more capable of standing the etching,
and then be coated with neutral or very slightly acidulated gum.
After gumming, the stone is again dried and allowed to stand for
some hours to rest, after which it can be inked up and etched, and
finally sharp etched.</p>

<p>The zinc plate is, after development, also well washed, then
allowed to dry, treated with thin gum solution,
then with an <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
etching solution of tincture of galls or gallic acid and phosphoric
acid, and inked up.</p>

<p>Prints on zinc plates for deep etching are gummed after developing,
and if the asphalt film is perfect without rubbing up with a
pad, which thickens the drawing, etched for some minutes in very
dilute nitric acid.</p>

<p>Many lithographers are accustomed, and indeed it is necessary
with some transfers, to rub the prints up with greasy ink.
The process is as follows:—Greasy transfer ink is diluted with
some turpentine, and after the stone has been gummed and allowed
to dry, then washed, the drawing is wiped over with a soft pad
with this dilute ink, when the ink adheres to the drawing,
strengthens it, and if great care is not taken, thickens it also.
With asphalt prints this is absolutely useless, and for other direct
prints, as well also as for good chromated gelatine prints, in most
cases unnecessary. The exposed asphalt combines so intimately
with the stone that strengthening with a greasy ink is quite unnecessary,
is indeed absolutely purposeless, as the ink can neither
penetrate the hard asphalt film nor combine with it. The film of
asphalt alone is so resistant to every etching solution that it is for
this reason absolutely useless to strengthen it.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3 class="h3blk">2. OTHER PROCESSES.</h3>

<p>Besides the asphalt other mixtures of other light-sensitive
substances may be used for direct printing, and these are mostly
organic substances in combination with a chromium salt, and
possess also a greater sensitiveness to light than asphalt.</p></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Solution A is
strongly sensitive to light, and is used for coating
the stone or zinc plate; with solution B the stone is coated before
developing. The details of the process are as follows:—</p>

<p>After the stone has been carefully polished and well dusted it
should be first flowed over with distilled water, in order to
increase the possibility of spreading the sensitive solution. When
the water has run off, the stone whilst still damp should be flowed
over with solution A, and care should be taken that the same is
evenly distributed and that no bubbles form. The
stone should be <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
placed immediately on the whirler and rotated till the solution is
dry. Obviously a thick film must be avoided, as in such a case
the print would not adhere to the stone.</p></div>

<p>If a zinc plate be used it must be well prepared and be rendered
free from grease. To prove this the plate is flowed over with
distilled water, and when this spreads equally all over and is not
repelled from any part, the solution can be poured on. If, however,
the plate does not willingly take water everywhere, it must
be again cleaned or polished. The other operations are the same
as for the stone.</p>

The duration of printing depends obviously also here again on two
important factors—the quality of the negative and the strength of
the light. Under a good negative with absolute bare glass in the
lines of the drawing I print to about 10° Vogel, for example:—</p></div>

to clean the same completely. The drawing now appears a deep
violet on a bright ground. The development is continued without
rubbing strongly with the pad—which might rub up the drawing—till

<p>This is printed under a reversed negative for about six minutes
in the sun. The plate is then laid for about half an hour in cold
water in order to remove the chromium salts, and then cleansed
from all soluble parts with a pad, and after well washing set up to
dry. It is then inked up with transfer ink, and after about
fifteen minutes washed with turpentine. This process, as, indeed,
all direct printing processes, offers many advantages for preparing
colour plates from a coloured object with one negative. The
register of the separate plates is very exact, which is not always
the case with a transfer process. In reproducing line drawings
the unnecessary parts on the stone or plate

THE HALF-TONE PROCESS FOR PHOTO-LITHOGRAPHY.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span>
half-tone process is used in photo-lithography to reproduce
originals which do not contain distinct lines or points, but closed
tones, which are executed either in one or several colours. With
this process any coloured picture, oil, water, pastel, indian-ink or
sepia drawing, as well as any photographs from nature of living,
moving scenes, or still life objects can be prepared for reproduction
on the printing press.</p></div>

<p>I will first describe briefly the theory of the process, and then
come to the practical part.</p>

<p>As regards the photographic part and the quality of the negatives,
in the present state of this method of reproduction the
same principles apply as in line reproduction; where they differ I
will mention the same.</p>

<p>The duration of printing, the transfer of the image to the stone,
as well as the other arrangements will be described in the different
processes.</p>

<p>We divide this chapter again into two sections:</p>

<p>1. Methods in which the half-tone is broken up when making
the negative.</p>

<p>2. Those methods in which the formation of the grain is effected
after the negative has been made by some suitable means.</p>

<span class="smmaj">THE</span>
<span class="smcap">N<b>EGATIVE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">(A<b>UTOTYPY</b>).</span></h3>

<p>Of the various methods by which a breaking-up of the half-tones
can be obtained, the so-called “autotypy” is the one most
used practically. With this process the half-tones are broken up
in the negative.</p></div>

<p>As every important technical discovery is formed not at once,
but must be made by a longer or shorter series of smaller discoveries
or improvements in order to attain the hoped-for goal, so
was it also with autotypy.</p>

<p>From the work of Paul Pretsch, Mariot, Brown, and Fred. E.
Ives the present state of the certain and beautifully-working half-tone
process gradually evolved, and the last process, which ought
to be considered as the immediate predecessor, is far outshone by
autotypy as now practised.</p>

<p>Early attempts were made to obtain a printable image on stone
by breaking up the chromated gelatine film, so that an irregular
so-called serpentine grain was formed on
it, which corresponded <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
fairly well with the theory of lithography, but gave no precise
lines and no beautiful gradations of stone. If the grain was
somewhat too coarse the effect of the picture was lost, the tone
gradations were too far apart, and only light and shadows were
given; if the grain was too fine the stone was not printable.</p>

<p>A further experiment was printing a design over the original,
the strength of which had to be brought in correct proportion to the
original; the impressing of a design was also tried, and when
using this method the correct angle of the incident light when
making the exposure had to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Further experiments, which were principally carried out by
Mariot, Cronenberg, and others, were founded principally on the
basis of breaking up the tones in printing. For this a lineature
or screen on glass, or a gelatine film, was introduced between the
negative and the sensitive film. Others, again, coated the blank
glass plate with a lineature, and prepared the plate afterwards
with collodion or gelatine emulsion for the exposure.</p>

<p>It will be thus seen how this method of reproduction developed
step by step till net-work of silk muslin or woven horsehair, and
finally grating images, strongly reduced by photography, were
placed in front of the photographic plate.</p>

<p>Thus were efforts made to make half-tone pictures suitable for
printing by litho-&nbsp;or typography, and although the end was very
nearly attained, yet the crux was not quite solved. These methods
did not, however, yield the desired result, namely, a beautiful
sharp clear image. There was still required a considerable improvement
of the existing methods, and this was made by Meisenbach,
of Munich.</p>

<p>The principle by which Meisenbach prepared his images was
essentially different from the previously-described results. He
broke up the half-tones, also by means of a lineature, into a printable
grain, but the process was essentially different from the previous
methods, in that Meisenbach used a glass plate on which, on
a black ground, a grating was drawn till the glass was laid bare,
and in this way prepared a lineature which consisted of clear glass,
transparent lines and absolutely opaque lines.</p>

<p>He produced, first, an ordinary negative, from this a positive,
and from this, by the interposition of the lineature, the actual
half-tone negative for making the printing plate. The lineature
or screen was in the second exposure interposed before the sensitive
plate, and half the time of exposure given; then the screen
was turned till the line first obtained crossed the second at an
angle of 90°, and then the exposure was completed. By this
means an absolutely certain breaking up of the half-tones into
mathematically exact points was attained, and the most important
step made in making photography useful for preparing printing
plates for the two principal methods, typographic and lithographic.
Meisenbach has called his process “autotypy.”
It was, indeed, <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
somewhat inconvenient, but had the advantage that on the negative
and also on the positive any retouching that was necessary
could be done.</p>

<p>I cannot here enter into the numerous simplifications and improvements
of Meisenbach’s process which, as well in the photographic
process as also in the preparation of the lineature, were in
the course of time made partly by him and partly by Carl
Angerer, Gillot, Bussod and Valadon, Lefmann, and others, since,
on the one hand, it would carry us too far, and, on the other hand,
they may be considered as a natural consequence of the discovery.
I will only mention that it was found after a short time that the
two exposures and the production of the necessary positive could
be omitted, and that the lineature could be simply interposed
before the sensitive plate in the first exposure, by which an important
simplification of the work was attained, and, thanks to the
continued perfecting of the processes, no detraction of the good
results was thus produced.</p>

<p>I do not consider it superfluous to give a short explanation of
the action of the interposed lineature on the photographic plate
during exposure.</p>

<p>If we take, for the sake of simplicity, not a picture, but a scale
with four or five-tone gradations from light to deep black, the
light tones will act more or less on the sensitive photographic
plate according to their degree of brightness, but as the rays of
light have to pass through the cross-lined screen interposed between
the lens and sensitive plate, and as the rays can only pass
through the transparent parts and not through the opaque, no
homogeneous surface is obtained on the negative, but a tone produced
by the cross-lines of the screen. If the tone was very
bright, the rays reflected with great intensity on the sensitive plate will
completely decompose the silver film. Since they are prevented by
the screen from acting with equal power on all places of the surface,
these places will show very plainly on the negative, and the
result is therefore a darker tone on the same, which is marked
with bright fine lines, corresponding in thickness to the screen
plate.</p>

<p>If the original tone was darker so many rays of light will not be
reflected, and these have thus not the power to impress the screen
on the sensitive plate in full intensity; the result is therefore on
the negative a tone which does not contain such strong dark lines
as the first; the tone appears lighter in the negative, and in the
print from the same darker than the first.</p>

<p>In the reproduction of deep black surfaces finally no rays of
light are reflected, therefore no rays of light can penetrate through
the screen, and because actually here no chemical change of the
light sensitive film takes place, we obtain a negative which is
clear and transparent in these places, that is to say without any
interruption, which gives in the print a
full black tone. <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span></p>

<p>In this process there comes, however, to our aid a very important
physical law, namely, the diffraction of light. A ray of light
passing through a round hole or a slit and falling on to a black
surface is represented not the same size as the slit, but more or
less broadened the more the receiving surface is moved away, and
in the middle the brightest light will be, and this gradually fades
off into shadow towards the margin.</p>

<p>If we take now the opposite, and use instead of the hole or slit
a black surface or a conglomerate of such in the form of points,
squares, or other geometrical figures, and if these be placed before
a screen illuminated with a bright light, these figures become
somewhat smaller with this bright illumination, whilst with a
weaker illumination they are represented in correct strength.</p>

<p>Where the light acts in its full intensity, or in excess, in a
manner of speaking it is diffracted or bent over the figures, and
proportionately makes them smaller.</p>

<p>This law does good service in autotypic work.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the rays of light must pass through the screen
during exposure. This screen consists of equally thick opaque
black and transparent white lines. Where the light acts with full
intensity it will be more diffracted over the black lines. It makes
the lines of the screen broader on the negative, and will, therefore,
have more covered places, which in the after printing of the prints
cannot be penetrated by the light, and thus represent the light
places in the print covered with fine dots.</p>

<p>The darker the tone the less the rays of light reflected, and the
less, therefore, can the light be diffracted. As the tones get darker
the lines of the screen become of equal value on the negative, till
finally, when at the opposite end of the screen, they totally
disappear in the deep blacks.</p>

<p>A valuable quality of a correctly-prepared autotype is, therefore,
that the covered lines or the covered grain appear of different
strengths on the negative. In the high lights they are stronger, in
the half-tones weaker, till finally in the black parts they have
totally disappeared.</p>

<p>A further not less valuable property is that the grain in the
highest lights is not sharply defined, does not appear as a square
point, but is rounded by the diffraction of light, which gives a
softer, more beautiful appearance and plasticity.</p>

<p>Whilst the light reflected from the brightest parts of the drawing
acts with full intensity, and is diffracted over the figures
standing in its path and makes the same smaller, and cuts off the
sharp corners and gives more covered surfaces to the negative, as
it decreases according to the more or less deep shadows of the
drawing, and can only act now with less intensity through the
open places of the screen, the result is that the points become
larger, till finally in the deepest parts it is quite inactive, and the
shadows begin to block. The action of the light
rays of different <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
strengths reflected on to the negative in accordance with the
brighter and darker tones of the drawing, taking into consideration
the print, can be graphically represented as a pyramid of which the
base represents the deepest shadows and the point the high lights.
If we interpose a cross-lined screen, or more correctly called a
grain plate, before the sensitive plate, we obtain, graphically considered,
grain figures, actually of many more very different sizes,
as shown in Fig. 7, 1–6, in which the smallest points represent
the high lights of the drawing, and those becoming gradually
bigger the gradually increasing shadows.</p>

<div class="dctr02">
<img src="images/i071.png" width="600" height="436" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">Fig. 7.</div></div>

<p>The original grain plate contained, measured diagonally, five
black points, five white interstices to the millimetre. The figures
represent enlargements of a negative made with the above-named
grain plate, and for this the grain plate was one millimetre distant
from the sensitive plate.</p>

<p>The accompanying Figure 8, 1–6, represents very much enlarged
the scheme of grain of an autotype from a perfectly-executed
wash drawing, with a screen of five opaque and five transparent
lines to the millimetre, in equal proportions of black and white, at
a distance of one millimetre from the sensitive plate, with equal
time of exposure before and after the turning of the screen, and
obviously with correct exposure for the whole.</p>

<p>The scheme is only given here in six gradations of tone. As a
matter of fact, a good autotype has at least from six to eight times
the number of tones, as with a sharp screen and
an original cleanly <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
and sharply drawn in many tones, the light reflects the least
alteration of tone in the size of the grain.</p>

<div class="dctr02">
<img src="images/i072.png" width="600" height="444" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">Fig. 8.</div></div>

<p>As previously mentioned, the smallest points represent the
highest lights of the drawing; the larger, according to our graphic
representation, the darker tones, but a correct reproduction of the
grain.</p>

<p>In a similar way obviously the formation of the lines on the
negative behave with an interposed but not revolved screen. Here
also the lines in the high lights of the negative appear more covered
than in the shadows.</p>

<p>The proportion of grain can, if the original requires it, be so far
altered by not giving equal exposures for each position of the
screen—for instance, in the proportion of two to one or three to
one. We obtain then on the given scheme less closed tone gradations,
3, 4, and 5, and just before 3, and between and after 5, tone
gradations, no single black and white points, but more or less jagged
black or white lines, whilst the open black grain in 1 and 2 becomes
more an oval instead of the round form in 6, and beyond the round
openings are drawn out into ovals.</p>

<p>We have, however, in autotypy still the physical law, which is
very useful to us, and that is the greater or less distance of the
point from the light surface. The nearer a point or a figure is
brought to the wall on which it should throw the shadow, the
greater the size of the original, and so much sharper will be the
outlines of the shadows. The more the point or
the figure is <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
removed from the wall the less the shadow will correspond to the
shape of the original; it will be smaller and less defined. The
shape will also frequently change, and a square will become a
round. We have then in the near or distant position of the
lineature to the sensitive plate, on which it throws its shadow, an
important assistance to act on the general tone gradations of the
image. Let us remember that in focussing the shadow-forming
object on to the surface on which the light falls, we obtain the
same formed in all its actuality on the receiving surface; therefore,
when this refers to a lineature with equal proportions of black and
white, we obtain these in equal ratio. When, however, we remove
the lineature from the light-receiving surface, the shadows which
it throws contract, the lights predominate, we obtain no longer the
ratio of 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;1 between light and shadow, but about 1·5&#x202f;:&#x202f;1 and
so on.</p>

<p>By placing the lineature close to the sensitive plate, we obtain
more closed tones, and as this gradation of tone is carried
naturally throughout the whole of the image, also less high
lights, less deep, middle shadows, whilst the deep shadows
appear in their natural strength. With the removal of the
lineature from the sensitive plate, on the other hand, the ratio of
tones for the whole image, as well as for the details, is displaced.
In the first place we shall obtain a picture which contains more
contrasts of black and white. The light tones become considerably
lighter by the reduction of the shadows. The dark parts, on the
other hand, attain full vigour. In the first place, therefore, the
original has to be considered as regards the distance of the
lineature from the sensitive plate. Obviously, therefore, no
accurate directions can be given in a case where feeling and
experience are required. Next to the original, the number of the
lines on the screen has to be considered. As a rule, one uses
lineatures with five or six transparent and opaque lines to the
millimetre
(=&nbsp;125–150 to the inch), and for these a distance of
½ to 1 mm.
<span class="nowrap">(=&nbsp;1&#x2060;/&#x2060;50–1&#x2060;/&#x2060;25th</span>
inch) from the sensitive plate is generally
sufficient for most cases. With a less number of lines the
distance can be increased.</p>

<p>Autotypy is a process in which unprintable half-tones can be
broken up by the use of a well-defined physical law into a
mathematically determined grain, and the size of the grain can
also be regulated to a certain extent with certain precautions.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, easily understood that the autotypic process is
now very general and most used, and not only in the limited
department of photo-lithography, but in a more extended way,
does excellent service for the preparation of illustrations of all
kinds, for the simplest picture for the daily paper as for the
finely-printed magazines and journals, for simple monochromatic
printing, and for the highest colour printing.</p>

<p>With accurate knowledge and command of
the technique of <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
photography and lithography, there is required before everything,
for successful work, a faultless screen plate. The indispensable
requirements which must be found in the screen are absolutely
opaque black lines and bare glass in the white lines. The home
preparation of such a screen plate is a somewhat difficult matter,
and will not be absolutely successful if one has not a faultless
ruling machine, a composition which is thoroughly opaque, which
adheres well to the glass and gives clean, sharp lines in ruling,
and which does not chip, and it will require a tremendous expenditure
of patience and perseverance. Glass screens of excellent
quality may now be obtained commercially.</p>

<p>For reproduction of the very highest quality, a drawn and
etched screen plate is more suitable than one merely ruled on
pigment, which never gives such sharp results.</p>

<p>From various firms etched screen plates may now be obtained
either as single or crossed-line screens, which fulfil all requirements.</p>

<p>The best screen to use is one with five or six opaque and
transparent lines to the millimetre, which corresponds with
2,500 to 3,600 points to the square centimetre. The above
number of lines will suffice for nearly all work, and such screens
give reproductions in which the grain is no longer visible to the
naked eye, but appears as a closed tone. It is not advisable to go
beyond this number of lines, except in special cases, when the
details of the drawing in the original are specially small. With
a smaller number of about three or four lines to the millimetre,
too coarse a grain results, of which the individual points become
too plainly visible, and these are distracting and act roughly, and
do not accurately reproduce the gradation of tone.</p>

<p>The best proportion between opacity and transparency is 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;1.
From this is obtained, according to my opinion, the most beautiful
and restful tones. It must also be remembered that the opaque
spots actually lose considerably in strength in the brighter
portions of the picture by the spreading action of the light.</p>

<p>The printing may be done on bichromated gelatine paper,
with which, however, extremely accurate inking up of the print
is essential, and the prints must not have too much ink and must
be very carefully printed. If, however, very good, clear negatives
are used, either of the direct printing methods, as already
described in Chapter IV., is to be preferred. (See No. 4 Supplement.)</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the use of light sensitive
asphalt for the preparation of printing plates for the various
branches is by no means new.</p></div>

<p>The fundamental principles of the well-known processes we find
also used in the process of Orell, Füssli, and Co.</p>

<p>The grained stone is coated with a thin film of light-sensitive
asphalt, the composition of which we have previously learnt, and
exposed under a reversed or stripped negative. The image after
correct exposure is developed, and then, according to the construction
of the asphalt, in combination with the graining of the stone
and the developer, there is formed a finer or coarser grain, or a
closed or open image.</p>

<p>The development is effected with petroleum, to which one-fifth
or one-sixth of its volume of benzine is added, or with turpentine
alone. Development takes place rather rapidly, and after a short
time the image appears on the stone. The print is then treated as
was suggested in asphalt printing; the stone is first gummed, and
then by rolling up with ink and etching rendered suitable for
printing. The pictures produced by this have a very fine grain
and are in appearance very much like good collotypes; still two
or more tones are necessary to obtain an absolutely closed and
vigorous action.</p>

<p>Very similar to Orel and Füssli’s process is the following, also
patented.</p>

<p>In this process also all the colour stones of a chromo picture are
produced from a single stripped and reversed negative which is
taken of the original. For the preparation of any colour stone
there are three distinct stages. The first stage is the exposure,
the second the development, and the third the development continued
still further, and any necessary small help by the lithographer.
In each stage a special mode of treatment is required,
according to whether the stone in question is to be used for a light,
a more vigorous, or full colour. The stones for grey and the light
blue or light red inks—thus those for many surfaces, but with few
details—are treated differently to those for yellow,
the second red <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span>
or blue; and these, again, differently to those for brown or quite
dark colours.</p></div>

<p>Everyone only slightly conversant with colour printing knows
that the first plates are used for the general tones of the picture,
and contain, therefore, few details, and with the exception of the
highest lights are tolerably full; the latter plates, on the other
hand, which are devoted to the darker colours, contain less toned
surfaces, but, on the contrary, more details of the drawings.
In order to attain this correctly the three stages of the production
of the plates are carried out with this end in view.</p>

<p>It should still be mentioned that the more or less fine graining of
the stone determines the general ratio of the grain of the picture.</p>

<p>The first stage is the exposure of grained stone coated with
asphalt. With longer or shorter exposure it is possible to make
the asphalt film more or less soluble, that is to say, to make the
same more or less capable of resisting ethereal oils.</p>

<p>It is therefore possible at this stage, by long exposure of the
asphalt film, to give to the colour stone for bright colours more
tone and less details. The stones for the darker inks are printed
for a shorter time, and the asphalt film is less capable of withstanding
the solvents, and the resulting plate contains less tones
and more details. Finally, the plates for the deep colours are
normally printed; the asphalt film is still less resistant, and consequently
the stone will only have tone and details on those places
which in printing ought to be the darkest.</p>

<p>It is possible, therefore, by correct manipulation of this operation,
to obtain approximately the correct colour plate.</p>

<p>There is, however, in the second process a corrector for the first.
The development may be so performed that by the longer or
shorter use of strong solvents, Hungarian or Russian turpentine,
more or less of the asphalt will be dissolved. Thus if a slight
error is made in printing it can be made good in developing. As
a rule, the stones for bright colours, which consist of many tones,
are not developed so long as those for the stronger colours. The
actual stones for the deep colours are very strongly developed, so
that almost all the delicate parts of the picture disappear, and
only the dense strong parts remain on the stone.</p>

<p>Still the fine details which are to be found in the vigorous
parts, and which cannot be recognized, must be brought out. The
fine parts of the drawing must be quite clear if the details are to
be recognized, or the picture will be a fuzzy copy of the original,
wanting in structure.</p>

<p>This fault is remedied in the third stage of the treatment, in
which a strong development of the picture is effected with strong
acting oils or benzole and turpentine. As this operation, however,
would also wash away such delicate places which ought to
remain on the colour stone, they must be covered with solution of
gum and allowed to dry. Then those parts not
covered with gum, <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
in which the details of the image cannot be seen, are painted for a
longer or shorter time, as may be required, with a brush dipped in
the developing solution, and when correctly developed may be
covered up. The lighter places are treated for a shorter time, the
very dark places for a longer time.</p>

<p>By this treatment the particular parts of the picture become
lighter and lighter, the details appear more and more; and,
finally, the whole picture shows as it should do. Then the gum is
washed off and the stone subjected to the already described treatment,
so as to make it suitable for printing in quantities. Finally,
the lithographer can make corrections with a needle or tusch.</p>

<p>This process may be used, therefore, to prepare colour-printing
plates from a negative obtained in the camera from an oil painting
or any coloured original.</p>

<p>The negative for this process must contain all the details very
clear, must be soft, and not be too dense.</p>

<p>The different colour plates are thus in this process obtained by
long or short printing, by strong or weak developing, and finally
the details in the dark plates are obtained by separate development
and covering up the other places with gum.</p>

<p>The breaking up of the half-tones into printable grain is effected
by graining the stone, before coating with the light sensitive
asphalt film. On the finer or coarser graining of the stone depends
also the structure of the grain of the image.</p>

<p>This process yields the most beautiful results with correct
manipulation, and in the hands of an expert photographer and
lithographer is a valuable aid to the preparation of colour plates.
The process is patented.</p>

<p>Bartös’ process belongs to those in which the breaking up of the
half-tones into a printable grain is effected subsequently on the
plate or stone by mechanical means. This is attained in a very
original manner by means of a sandblast, which makes the half-tone
printable. We have here not the breaking up of the half-tones
in a mathematically regular manner, dependent on optical
laws, as is the case with autotypy, but a method similar to that of
Pretsch, which obtains the printable grain by reticulation of the
chromated gelatine film, or other discoverers who attain the same
result by asphalt dusting or some other means.</p></div>

<p>For this process a well-polished litho stone or zinc plate is coated

all its details in grain on the varnish of the stone or plate. The
image is now visible on the film of varnish, according to the
strength of the tones in partial graining, and can be etched into
the stone or plate.</p>

<p>This is effected by etching with phosphoric acid—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">and allowed to dry.</p>

<p>Then the film of varnish is removed with a pad of cotton wool
damped with turpentine, the dry stone rolled up with litho ink,
damped, and the excess of ink rolled off. The picture now shows
with all its finest details on the stone, and can be printed.</p>

<p>In preparing a relief printing plate the film of varnish forms the
resist for the first etching. It is then rolled up and etched in the
usual way.</p>

<p>For preparing larger pictures on stone or metal plates, in which
the grain must be coarser than with small pictures, the fully-developed
and still damp pigment image is dusted with powdered
resin and the film allowed to dry with the powder adhering to it.
The pigment image thus dusted is treated, as previously described,
with alum and glycerine, exposed to the action of the sandblast,
and then etched with phosphoric or nitric acid.</p>

<p>As the soft pigment film receives a grain by the dusting, this is
reproduced of the same size by the action of the sandblast on the
film of varnish on the stone or plate.</p>

<p>The principal points of this process of preparing photo-lithographs
or phototypes in half-tone, with a grain, are as follows:—</p>

<p>1. From the photographic negative a pigment
image is taken <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
and transferred to a litho stone or zinc plate, which has been previously
coated with varnish.</p>

<p>2. The pigment image is then exposed to the action of the
sandblast; and</p>

<p>3. Then the pigment image is removed, and the image obtained
on the film of varnish is etched.</p>

<p>In the K.K. Hof und Staatsdruckerei photo-lithographs as well
as phototypes have been prepared with excellent results by this
process. The former in result are similar to the productions of the
Orell and Füssli process, and the latter were noticeable for good
gradation. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that this process,
which is patented, has been already surpassed by autotypy,
which is far simpler and easier to work, and is founded on a
scientific basis.</p>

<h4 class="h4blk">(<span class="smmaj">D.</span>)
<span class="smcap">L<b>ITHO-HELIOGRAVURE.</b></span></h4>

<p>This process, invented by Chas. Eckstein, of Hague, the general
director of the Topographical Bureau of the Royal Netherland
General Staff, also belongs to those processes of photo-lithography
by means of which any picture in half-tone can be reproduced.
The breaking up of the half-tones is effected, as with the autotypic
methods, by the use of a lineature, but instead of this being done
in the photographic exposure, it is effected direct on the stone
before the transfer of the photographic image. In this particular
process the stone itself is not coated with a light sensitive film and
printed on direct, but the ruling is made on the stone, and then a
negative pigment image—a diapositive—is transferred to it exactly
the same as with photogravure on copper. A further feature is
that the result is not an ordinary transfer stone result, but an
intaglio etched stone, which is printed from the depressions.</p></div>

<p>For this original process the basis is a ruled pattern stone,
prepared with great care and accuracy. For preparing this a grey
stone of the best quality should be taken, and one without any
chalky spots, crystals, or holes. This should be polished with a
coarse cloth and oxalic acid solution till it has a very high polish.
On the highly-polished stone surface is spread a very thin but even
film of asphalt.</p>

<p>The solution is composed of—</p>

<div class="dtablebox">

<p>This mixture is boiled, and to it whilst boiling is added in
drops a solution of two parts of soda. When cold this mixture,
which is fairly hard, is dissolved in about an equal volume of turpentine,
filtered and kept in bottles for use.</p>

<p>A sufficient quantity of this asphalt solution, which must not be
sensitive to light, is poured into the middle of a
levelled stone and <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
distributed by means of a lithographic ink roller, which must not
be used for any other purpose but this, till the coating is absolutely
even and shows a light brown colour.</p>

<p>When this film has become quite hard, fine parallel lines are
drawn over the whole surface of the stone with a very accurate
working ruling machine, by means of which from five to ten lines
per millimetre can be ruled.</p>

<p>When the ruling is finished the stone is given a margin of wax,
and quickly and evenly flooded with the following etching fluid—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">may
be used and allowed to act for half-a-minute. The stone is
then well washed under a strong stream of water, allowed to dry,
and covered with linseed oil. After about five minutes the whole
of the stone may be washed with turpentine. Then it should be
inked up with a pad, care being taken that all lines take the ink
well and evenly. This pattern stone serves as the original plate
for the subsequent ruled transfer.</p>

<p>From the original ruled stone can be made, according to the
nature of the original, a single, double, triple, or four-fold transfer.</p>

<p>For preparing a stone with a ruled transfer, a smoothly ground
stone well polished with oxalic acid is evenly coated with sensitive
asphalt solution. On this, when dry, the desired single or crossed
transfer from the original stone is made, and dusted with bronze
powder. This adheres to the lines of the pattern, and in combination
with the printing ink protects the asphalt film underneath
from the action of light. During the subsequent exposure, which,
according to the sensitiveness of the asphalt and intensity of the
light, can last from a half to two hours or more, the particles of
asphalt not covered by the bronze powder become insoluble, whilst
the protected parts preserve their solubility.</p>

<p>After correct exposure the surface of the stone is carefully
washed with a tuft of cotton wool soaked in oil of turpentine,
when the particles of asphalt underlying the bronzed lines dissolve.
The stone at these parts is laid quite bare, and therefore
made capable of being subsequently etched. The deep etching of
the pattern is effected in the same way as was suggested in the
preparation of the mother pattern stone.</p>

<p>By this method a positive pattern is obtained, that is to say, the
lines print, and the impression shows therefore a black network.</p>

<p>A second method of making a pattern transfer consists in
making a pull from the original stone on to
chalk transfer paper. <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
This pull is then damped on the back, and when just properly
damp is laid on the polished stone (without any asphalt) and the
transfer made. In order to remove the chalk paper without
damaging the pattern the stone is covered with warm water, when
the lines will dissolve. The simple pattern will now be found on
the stone, which should now be well washed, then dusted with
resin powder, which should be melted on with ether vapour.
Then if the direction of the first lines was vertical, the second
transfer is arranged with the direction of the lines horizontal to
the first, and there is thus obtained a simple crossed pattern.
With four-fold crossed patterns the subsequent pulls are made in
opposite diagonal directions. After each transfer the stone is well
washed, allowed to dry, then dusted with resin powder, and with
ether melted on to the pattern.</p>

<p>The stone is now deep etched with dilute nitric or acetic acid
and covered with linseed oil.</p>

<p>By this method a grain instead of lines is obtained. By
polishing the stone and transferring on to it, as well as by etching
the places not covered by the ink, we have the pattern reversed,
that is to say, it is converted into grain.</p>

<p>For further operations of litho-heliogravure a very clear and
soft negative is required, from which a glass transparency is
taken. Under this transparency pigment paper sensitized on a
20 per cent. solution of potassium bichromate is printed to 8 or 10
degrees Vogel. Printing must be very carefully performed, as
with under-printing too many details are lost. The exposed
pigmented paper is washed in cold water, laid film side down on
the previously prepared stone, and pressed into contact with an
india-rubber squeegee. It should then be allowed to dry in a not
too dry or too warm place.</p>

<p>The stone should now be placed in a trough with warm water
of about 40 to 45° C., and care should be taken to obtain water of
as even a temperature as possible. After about five minutes the
paper will be free from the stone, which should remain in the
bath and be developed so long by shaking in order that the water
may flow evenly over it till the image appears quite distinct; a
negative image is thus obtained on the stone. The film is then
allowed to dry spontaneously for four or five hours till the pigment
image has become quite hard.</p>

<p>For etching a solution of perchloride of iron of various strengths
is used, 40, 37, 33, and 30° Beaumé. With subjects very rich in
tones all four will be used; with simpler subjects one or the other
may be omitted.</p>

<p>The etching will begin, as a rule, with the 40° solution. The
ferric chloride will first dissolve the thin, hardened pigment film
and then go through the open lines of the pattern, where it will
attack the stone and etch the deepest parts.</p>

<p>Slowly the ferric chloride dissolves also
the thicker pigment <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
film—begins also to etch the stone there, but less deeply. To tell
when the four solutions should be used in turn, as well as the
correct moment to interrupt the etching, requires considerable
experience. The 30° solution, the weakest of the ferric chloride
solutions, is used last, and in consequence of the greater proportion
of water possesses a solvent power for the whole of the light-hardened
pigment film. Accurate directions as to how long the
etching with the different solutions is to be continued cannot be
given, as this depends upon the character of the subject as well as
upon the thickness of the pigment image. It may be always
assumed, however, that any individual etching ought to last under
no circumstances longer than three to four minutes. With well-covered
stones the first etching should not be allowed to act so long
as the last, and <i>vice-versâ</i> with less covered stones.</p>

<p>As soon as the image shows the correct character through the
etching solution the stone should be brought under the tap in the
trough and quickly washed with clean cold water. The surface of
the image should then be flowed over with oil of turpentine in
order to remove the asphalt and gelatine film, and finally well
washed with the rose and allowed to dry. The picture will be
found deeply etched into the stone. The stone is now smeared
over with linseed oil, inked up, and further treated as in ordinary
lithogravure.</p>

<p>In this process the negative pigment image is transferred to the
stone and the printing image prepared by etching; the formation
of the grain is produced by the pattern printed either on a
polished stone, when it is converted into points, or the transfer may
be effected on to an asphalted polished stone, when a network of
lines will be obtained.</p>

<p>For dark subjects the latter process is better, for lighter subjects
the grain.</p>

<p>Printing from such a plate has more similarities with etching
printing than from stone; the effect of the ink is very good and
expressive.</p>

<p>Various pictures executed by Eckstein and in our establishment
in one or more colours have proved the value of this process in
practice.</p>

<p>The foregoing are the different photo-lithographic methods for
obtaining printing images in half-tone, and although in no way
exhaustive, yet it appears to me that they are practically the most
important.</p>

properties of bichromated gelatine paper can also be very well
used for the so-called negative printing, and this method offers
many advantages.</p></div>

<p>In order to convert a positive printing image into a negative
various methods may be used; the most convenient for the lithographer
is the following:—A good litho stone is first ground in
the ordinary way and then the surface rubbed with a pad and
oxalic acid solution till it has a high glaze or polish. On to this
stone is then transferred a sharp impression in a non-greasy ink
from the positive printing image. According to the destination of
the stone for large or small editions one of two processes may be
adopted. If a thousand or more pulls are required from the stone
the transfer may be dusted with resin powder, and this melted
with the burning, heating, or ether process and the drawing etched
in relief with 8 to 12° nitric acid and gum. Then the stone may
be well washed with water and the acid removed with one to two
per cent. acetic acid.</p>

<p>For small runs the first etching is omitted, and the stone treated
with acetic acid. In both cases the stone should be well washed,
dried, and then coated with dissolved lithographic tusch or autographic
ink. The greasy substances of these materials penetrate
into the surfaces of the stone that are laid bare, and firmly adhere.
When the tusch or ink is completely dry the stone is washed with
turpentine, inked up, and one now has a negative image from the
subject in question, which shows all the original printing places in
white and all white places black.</p>

<p>The process of preparing such negative prints by the use of
bichromated gelatine papers is much simpler.</p>

<p>A sheet of gelatinized paper is sensitized for this purpose on a
5 per cent. bath of potassium bichromate, squeegeed to a sheet of
plate-glass and well dried, and on this is made with black ink,
which is very opaque, in the dark or in gaslight, a sharp clean
print. This print is then laid on a flat cable, under a sheet of
plate-glass, so that it cannot roll up, and exposed to the light for
from five to thirty minutes. A long exposure rarely does harm in
such cases, as the good opaque black ink allows no rays of light
to pass through to those places which later should print white.</p>

<p>The next manipulation is the development and inking up, which
is done as in ordinary photo-lithography. In
this operation all <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
those places which were not covered up by the printing will take
the developing ink; on the other hand, those places where the impression
was will wash out clean and white. The print has
assumed the appearance of a photographic positive. The print is
now treated like any other photo-lithographic print, and finally
transferred to a stone or zinc plate. This method is distinguished
by its simplicity and safety; it has also the advantage that any
desired printing subject can be directly transferred in negative
form to a zinc plate for relief etching, which otherwise could only
be done by preliminary transfer to stone and subsequent transfer
to zinc.</p>

DRAWING WITH AUTOGRAPHIC INK OR LITHOGRAPHIC CHALK ON A
CYANOTYPE, SALTED OR OTHER PRINT FROM A PHOTOGRAPHIC
NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE.</span></h3>

<p>By autography we understand that method of reproduction by
which any writing or drawing is made on a prepared or not prepared
paper with greasy ink, tusch or chalk, which is subsequently
transferred to stone or zinc for printing, or to zinc plates for relief
etching.</p></div>

<p>Autographic drawing papers differ for the different purposes,
and for writing and simple line drawings smooth hard post paper
is used, and lined transfer paper for fine pen or chalk drawings.
The latter are prepared commercially by Angerer and Göschl.
Very beautiful grained drawings can also be made for transfer on
pyramidal grain paper. The proof for such drawings is usually
done with lead pencil or red chalk, or it may also be made on a
gelatine proof.</p>

<p>In order to obtain fully and completely the character and correct
reproduction of the drawing, without special expense of artistic
help, it is advisable to use a photographic print as proof. It
should be noted that for pen drawing on smooth paper with greasy
tusch or ink, for chalk drawings on a prepared grained paper done
as previously mentioned, with greasy lithographic chalk, the
drawing should be transferred direct to zinc or stone in order to
save having to make subsequently a photographic print.</p>

<p>If a pencil, red crayon, or other proof is used for an autographic
drawing on paper with the idea of transferring it direct to stone
or zinc, a suitable photographic print may also be used on suitable
paper without any disadvantages.</p>

<p>For the prints all photographic papers without glaze, such as
ordinary plain salted paper, Eastman’s positive bromide paper,
and others, may generally be used. Glossy or albumenized papers
are not suitable for this, as the ink runs, and does not form solid
clean lines. <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span></p>

<p>The best of all, however, is cyanotype paper, as even with very
deep printing it keeps the details in the shadows open, and on
account of its blue tones is more suitable for the subsequent
drawing with black tusch. When, however, prussiate paper
is not handy, and subjects with fewer shadows and less details
are to be treated, any of the other papers above-mentioned may
be used.</p>

<p>If ferro-prussiate paper is to be used, the same may be prepared
as recommended on p. <a href="#p023" title="go to p. 23">23.</a></p>

<p>The so-called salted or plain paper is prepared as follows:—A
sheet of well-sized post paper is first bathed in a solution
of—</p>

<div class="dtablebox">

<p class="pcontinue">and
then sensitized in a solution of silver nitrate 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;12. It is
printed till the print has assumed a fairly full brown tone, and all
the details in the shadows are well printed out. It should then
be toned in the following toning bath:—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">till
the print has assumed a deep dark brown tone. It should
then be fixed in a solution of sodium hyposulphite, 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;15. It
should be printed rather deep, as in toning and fixing the image
loses in depth. It is moreover unnecessary in this case to make
a beautiful print; the chief thing is only that all details of the
image should be clearly seen. The print is then well washed
in frequent changes of water and then dried.</p>

<p>The print on Eastman’s bromide paper is prepared as follows:—</p>

<p>Red light must be used. It should be printed by an ordinary
gas flame at a distance of about 50–80 cm. (=&nbsp;24 to 36 ins.) for 1
to 20 seconds, according to the density of the negative. Here
again a technically perfect print need not be arrived at, but one
which contains all the details very clear. Under a good transparent
negative a useful image for the artist will be obtained with
about two seconds’ exposure.</p>

<p>The developer is composed of two solutions:—</p>

<p class="pcontinue">for
about ten minutes. Then well washed and dried.</p>

<p>For pen drawings all not gelatinized or albumenized printing
papers may be used as already mentioned. The chief thing is that
the paper should be well-sized and of good firm texture. If prepared
grain paper is used, which is provided with a film of chalk, kaolin,
or any other white colouring matter combined with gelatine, and
on which film the grain is impressed, only prussiate prints can be
used. The paper is sensitized as previously described, only it is
advisable not to leave it too long in the solutions, or else the film
may become softened. The film will also dissolve in hot water at
about 80° C.</p>

<p>The prints as soon as dry can be used for drawing on. On the
grain papers the outline may be drawn with the pen and be shaded
with chalk, or it may be drawn with chalk only. With unprepared
papers it is advisable to coat them with a thin solution of boiled
starch, as then the transfer to zinc or stone is most exact. The
drawing may also be left a long time without spoiling. The coating
is performed with a pad dipped into the liquid, which consists
of one part of fine bookbinder’s starch and four or five parts of
water, and passed several times over the print.</p>

<p>The drawings ought only to be done with greasy lithographic
tusch or chalk or autographic ink, which consists principally of
greasy materials and lampblack. For pen drawings hard pens
should be used, and care must be taken to make thick strokes.
Only a little tusch or ink ought to be taken into the pen, so that it
does not run out, and thus clean, sharp lines be obtained. If this
be observed very close shadings and cross lines can be produced
clean and neat.</p>

<p>When the drawing is finished and the tusch or ink has become
dry the same should be laid between damp blotting-paper, and
meanwhile a clean ground, and dry pumiced stone worked in the
press and the pressure correctly adjusted. As soon as the drawing
has become moderately damp right through, and the paper feels
soft without being wet, it should be laid with the image downwards
on the stone and transferred to the same with strong
pressure. After repeated working the paper will adhere firmly to
the stone. In order to loosen it the stone should be covered with
hot water of about 80° C., when the film will dissolve and the
paper become quite free. Any exertion of force
must in this <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
operation be quite avoided, and the paper must not be pulled off
with violence. All, even the finest lines, will have been transferred
to the stone. The stone is now gummed, if possible allowed
to stand for some hours, and then etched with a gum etching solution
of two degrees’ acid strength, or later etched in relief, and is
ready for printing. If the transfer is made to zinc, for printing
from this the plate is treated as suggested on p. <a href="#p006" title="go to p. 6">6.</a> If, however,
a relief etching for the typographic press is to be prepared of the
subject, the transfer is made on to a smooth polished zinc plate.</p>

<span class="smcap">L<b>ITHOGRAVURE.</b></span></h3>

<p>With this particular process an intaglio printing stone or
intaglio printing plate is prepared by
chemico-physical means.</p></div>

<p>This process was discovered and brought to great perfection by
Chas. Eckstein, the general director of the Typographical Bureau
at the Hague, and offers especially many advantages for the reproduction
of maps.</p>

<p>A map engraved, drawn, or transferred on stone, or written in
on copper, in originally one colour, can by this process in a comparatively
easy way be converted into a many-coloured print;
this process can also be used very advantageously for changing
the names for the places—rivers, mountains, etc. In the first place
intaglio original printing plates in all the colours can be prepared
which can then be printed for further reproduction; in the second
case it is necessary to re-engrave the network, hydrography, etc.</p>

<p>When it is desired to convert a monochrome image into a multi-coloured
map, as many stones as there are colours to be used must
be first ground and polished with oxalic acid till they have a high
polish.</p>

<p>In the meantime an asphalt or other light-sensitive solution
should be prepared, with which the stone is coated in the dark
very evenly, and somewhat more than is done for a photo-lithographic
print.</p>

<p>The asphalt solution is composed of—</p>

<div class="dtablebox">
<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">Syrian asphalt</p></td>
 <td><p class="tdpright">20</p></td>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">g.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">Chloroform</p></td>
 <td><p class="tdpright">300</p></td>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">g.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">Benzole</p></td>
 <td><p class="tdpright">100</p></td>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">g.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">Oil of lavender</p></td>
 <td><p class="tdpright">20</p></td>
 <td><p class="tdpleft">drops.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>After it has been dried in the dark the impression from the
black plate, which should be previously made on transfer paper, is
transferred to the asphalt film as previously laid down, and before
it is dry dusted with bronze powder. All lines, titles, or figures
which should not appear on that particular colour-plate must be
then covered with the above asphalt solution, and only those places,
for example, on the one plate all titles, on another all the roads, on
a third the river courses, and so on, should be left, all of which
later should appear in printing. <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span></p>

<p>The stone is now, according to the sensitiveness of the film and
the strength of the light, exposed for from fifteen minutes to two
hours. Over-printing, if it is not very exorbitant, does not do any
harm with the stronger letters or lines on account of the good
covering. With very fine lines, however, more care must be taken.
If there is any doubt as to the length of the exposure a test may be
made at one corner of the plate with a pad dipped in rectified
turpentine. When the asphalt will no longer dissolve the exposure
may be discontinued. With some experience the photometer may
also be used.</p>

<p>Then the whole surface should be washed with rectified turpentine
and a pad of cotton wool, when the ink lying under the bronze,
that is, the lines where the asphalt has been protected from the
action of light dissolve, and the surface of the stone appears. The
rest of the asphalt film has become insoluble from the action of
light, and now forms the etching-ground for the reversed negative
image on the surface of the stone.</p>

<p>When the stone has been well washed with water it may be
etched, which is done with glacial acetic acid two parts, water 100.
When there are any fine lines in the drawing the etching is interrupted
at the end of two minutes, and they should then be
covered with tusch, and then when the tusch is dry the other
parts are further etched for a longer or shorter time according to
the degree of fineness. In any case the time of etching should
not exceed five minutes. The stone is allowed to dry and then
coated with a solution of tusch or linseed oil, which penetrates
into the etched parts and makes them capable of taking ink.
After about ten minutes the whole stone should be washed with
turpentine or benzole, by which the etching ground is removed,
when the stone is inked up like an ordinary gravure.</p>

<p>In this way is obtained a stone with deep etched drawing,
which according to the blocking contains the titles, the rivers or
roadways, and from which subsequently the necessary gravures
can be taken. This stone can either be used for direct printing
or it may be used as an original stone from which the necessary
transfer can be made.</p>

<p>The same process may also be made for intaglio printing plates
on zinc or copper, only then the etching must be done with nitric
acid or ferric chloride.</p>

<p>Instead of the transfer on the light sensitive film, a drawing on
transparent paper may be used, or a photographic transparency.
The exposure in this case, as the opaque ink and bronze powder
are not used, must be very carefully estimated.</p>

<p>The advantage of this process is that an intaglio printing surface
may be obtained so that engraving is entirely or partially avoided, and
that this printing surface may be used as an original from which the
reproductions are made.</p>

<div>To be followed next year by “Photograms of ’96.”</div>

<div class="fsz7">
<p><em class="em-bold">Photograms of ’95</em> aims to represent modern photography as “Royal Academy Pictures,”
“Pictures of the Year,” &amp;c., represent the arts of painting and sculpture.</p>

<p><em class="em-bold">The Work</em> consists of 96 pages, super-royal 8vo (9¾ by 6½), and is printed on heavy “art
printing” paper.</p>

<p><em class="em-bold">The Illustrations</em> are the finest possible photo-mechanical (half-tone) reproductions,
and are made by the <span class="smcap">M<b>EISENBACH</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>O.</b></span>, West Norwood.</p>

<p>There are about thirty full-page reproductions, and the same number of smaller sizes,

<span class="smcap">C<b>HEMIGRAPH</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>O.</b></span>, of
St. Louis, New York, and Chicago, U.S.A., and mounted on handsome boards. They represent

work of the <span class="smcap">N<b>ATIONAL</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>HEMIGRAPH</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>O.</b></span> has not been published in England, will be a revelation
to photographers and photo-mechanical workers alike, of the latest possibilities in
“process” work. It will be quite impossible to repeat these supplements, and therefore
impossible to supply any copies that may be demanded after the first edition is exhausted.</p>

<p><em class="em-bold">The Literary Portion</em> of the work includes critical notices of the two great British
Photographic Exhibitions, and special articles on the work of the year in the English-speaking
countries and colonies by some of the best-qualified writers in each country. Amongst them
are</p>

<p>BRITISH ISLES:—<span class="smcap">G<b>LEESON</b></span>

<p>CANADA:—A. M. <span class="smcap">C<b>UNNINGHAM</b></span>, President of The Photographic Association of Canada.</p>

<p><em class="em-bold">The British Exhibitions</em> of The Royal Photographic Society and The Salon have supplied
most of the originals for reproduction, but some of the gems of the provincial exhibitions
are also included.</p>

<p><em class="em-bold">Non-Exhibited Pictures</em> are represented as far as possible, for the aim is to embrace
the whole field of the year’s work.</p>

<p><em class="em-bold">American, Colonial, &amp;c.</em>, work is represented by a few typical pictures, selected by the
gentlemen who supply the matter dealing with the work of the various countries.</p>

<p><em class="em-bold">The Scientific and Practical</em> applications of photography are not ignored, though the
bulk of the space is devoted to art works. Some of the latest achievements in astronomy,
microscopy, &amp;c., are illustrated by reproductions of the finest recent work.</p>

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst pleft">Original spel­ling and gram­mar have
been generally retained, with some excep­tions noted
below. Original printed page numbers are shown like
this: {52}. Foot­notes have been relabeled 1–3, and moved
from within para­graphs to nearby locations between
para­graphs. A few mis­sing full stops were inserted, for
example after “avoided” on page
<a href="#p049" title="go to page 49">49</a>. The tran­scriber
pro­duced the cover image and hereby assigns it to
the public domain. Ditto marks have been removed and
replaced by repe­ti­tions of the referenced text. Original
page images are avail­able from archive.org—search for
“photolithography00frit”.</p>

<p>There are twenty-four advertisements at the end of the book. A new
heading is added at the beginning of that section.</p>

<ul>
<li>Page <a href="#p002" title="go to page 2">2</a>.
“thought than an English translation” is changed
to “thought that an English translation”.</li>

<li>Page <a href="#p038" title="go to page 38">38.</a>
In the sentence “If the desired blackening is not effected
with one application the operation must be completed”, it seems likely
that “completed” should be “repeated”.</li>

<li>Page <a href="#p039" title="go to page 39">39.</a>
“Gum arabic 17.5” to “Gum arabic 17·5”.</li>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
